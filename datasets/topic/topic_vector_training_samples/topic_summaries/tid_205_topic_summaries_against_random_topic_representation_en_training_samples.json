Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the match.The 1994 Caribbean Cup was the fifth edition of the Caribbean Cup and was played in Trinidad and Tobago. Qualification took place in various other locations around the Caribbean in early 1994.[3] At the time, FIFA had been testing variations on tournament rules,[4] and the tournament organizers had decided that any matches where the score was tied at the end of the normal 90 minutes would go to extra-time, which would feature a golden goal that, if scored, would be worth two goals.[1] Barbados, Grenada, and Puerto Rico were drawn into Group 1, and on January 23 the round-robin tournament kicked off in Barbados, with the home team falling 0–1 to Puerto Rico. Two days later, Grenada defeated Puerto Rico 2–0 after a golden goal in extra-time. This put Grenada at the top of the group with three points and a +2 goal difference.[3] Thus, the only way that Barbados could advance to the finals would be if they could beat Grenada by a margin of at least two goals."

    "Prime Minister Nick Clegg explained that parents have to moderate what children view online, calling for even young children to be educated on internet dangers. David Cameron led an attack on harmful websites for the youth, taking measures such as blocking pornography in internet-connected households by default unless requested otherwise, along with outlawing rape-themed pornography. The Prime Minister thinks that a simple web pop-up warnings are insufficient, so parents must police internet viewing. Nick Clegg expresses concerns regarding his own children's access to the internet, since they frequently use Clegg's--and his wife's--iPads, and labour leader Ed Miliband also expresses concern that his four and two year old sons may quite easily find inappropriate adult content on mobile phones or computers. Since children may use Facebook to surf the internet, the Deputy Prime Minister feels that Facebook's age limit is appropriate, but he feels parents must discuss internet dangers with their children to give children responsibility."

The end of an era is nearing and Messi feels like he still has to give his nation one parting gift before he retires from international duty. The Argentine has managed to win every cup available in club football, however, international trophies have always evaded his grasp. Thus this might be his last chance to rectify that statistic in his legacy.Messi enters the 2022 World Cup with a very mixed Argentina side. No longer is the country as feared as they once were but they still have some very strong names to help them get through the tournament. The attack is where the men in blue and white will shine. After failing to meet Inter Milan's transfer fee for Lautaro Martinez, Barcelona were unable to fulfill the Argentine's dream of playing alongside Lionel Messi at the club level. But the partnership can now be formed on the international stage.While Leo has struggled to find the back of the net in Barca's last 3 La Liga clashes, with the only goal coming off a penalty, Lautaro has enjoyed a rather successful beginning to the new season with Inter, scoring eight goals in the last 5 matches. Another attacker who is being considered to feature under Lionel Scaloni is Sevilla star, Lucas Ocampos. He has had an impressive season so far, as evident in his latest clash against Barcelona, where he caused a lot of trouble for the Catalan's backline. Scaloni has been extremely pleased with the Sevilla man that he decided to drop a regular member of the Argentine squad, Angel Di Maria."

    "he year 2020 has been one of the toughest years for humanity. It saw global challenges to our ways of life, our governments, and our economies. But 2021 has begun with a ray of hope: The beginning of vaccination drive around the world against COVID-19 is expected to gradually bring life back to some semblance of normalcy, and strengthen economic activity in a backdrop of supportive policy stance by most nations. The optimism is reflected in the projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). After a contraction of 3.5% in 2020, IMF expects the global economy to grow 5.5% in 2021 and 4.2% in 2022. The impact of COVID-19 has been severe across nations; however, nations are gradually working to recover.With a growth expectation of 11.5% in 2021, India is projected to be the fastest-growing trillion-dollar economy in the world. The decision to impose a complete lockdown in the first half of 2020 to combat the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a near-halt of its economic activities. Its negative impact was evident in two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, as a result of which India entered into a technical recession for the first time in its history. Overall, the country witnessed a contraction of 8% during 2020 according to the IMF. However, this is a temporary phase, and India is still a compelling growth story.The Union Budget presented on February 1, 2021 brought cheer to the markets and promises to focus on growth. Commending the Government of India on its Union Budget 2021-22, USISPF President and CEO Mukesh Aghi said, \"The Union Budget 2021-22 has taken into consideration the needs of all sectors of the economy, reflecting a robust growth plan for India to become a $5 trillion economy. Increased government spending in critical areas of the economy, such as agriculture, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and defense, has been much needed.\""

The US beat Thailand 13-0, claiming the biggest ever Women's World Cup win, showing why they are first in the world rankings. A record 6.1m tuned in to watch England beat Scotland, making it the UK's most watched women's game of all time.\n \n\n The viewing figures are proof that the popularity of the women's game is growing – with many football fans keen to tune in and support their country. But while this is great news for the sport, there still tends to be much less interest in women's national football teams compared to the men's teams.\n \n\n This is in part down to the fact that the development of women's football has been historically disadvantaged by national associations banning their members from allowing women's football to be played at their grounds. These bans started in 1921 and were only lifted in 1971. As sports writer Jim Weeks notes, ‚öÑ∫by this time, half a century of progress had been lost‚öÑπ. Of course, there is also far less money in women's football today, compared with men's, but there could also be another major factor."

    "LOS ANGELES – Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and other law enforcement authorities this morning arrested six people charged in three federal indictments that allege illegal firearms sales and drug distribution.  The arrests stem from an ATF-led investigation targeting the sale of guns in and around Compton and Mona Park in Willowbrook. During the course of the year-long investigation, authorities took more than 100 illegally trafficked firearms off the streets. Those taken into custody today face various federal charges, including conspiracy, illegal firearm sales, being a felon in possession of a firearm, and trafficking in crack cocaine and PCP. Two other defendants named in the indictments are fugitives who are being sought by authorities. (A fourth grand jury indictment charges one defendant who also remains a fugitive, and that indictment will remain under seal until that defendant is taken into custody.The illegal firearms trade fuels violence on the streets,‚öÑπ said United States Attorney Eileen M. Decker. ‚öÑ∫If individuals prohibited from purchasing firearms can readily obtain them in an underground market, the challenge of reducing gun violence in our communities is much greater. As we work to stem violent crime in and around Compton, we will, therefore, target those who are sources of the firearms and narcotics that sustain these underground markets."

    "Family and marriage may at first seem to be familiar topics. Families exist in all societies and they are part of what makes us human. However, societies around the world demonstrate tremendous variation in cultural understandings of family and marriage. Ideas about how people are related to each other, what kind of marriage would be ideal, when people should have children, who should care for children, and many other family related matters differ cross-culturally. While the function of families is to fulfill basic human needs such as providing for children, defining parental roles, regulating sexuality, and passing property and knowledge between generations, there are many variations or patterns of family life that can meet these needs. This chapter introduces some of the more common patterns of family life found around the world. It is important to remember that within any cultural framework variation does occur. Some variations on the standard pattern fall within what would be culturally considered the ‚öÑ∫range of acceptable alternatives.‚öÑπ Other family forms are not entirely accepted, but would still be recognized by most members of the community as reasonable."

This paper provides additional insight into drivers'choice of speed by using a survey of Indiana drivers. The survey is timely since Indianarecently raised speed limits on rural interstates to 70 mph.

    "The fledgling WFL did succeed in raising stagnant salaries in the NFL. Average salaries in professional football were among the lowest in the four major North American sports, and the National Football League Players Association and the Canadian Football League Players Association had both gone on strike prior to their leagues' respective 1974 seasons in an effort to lift many of the rules suppressing free agency and player salaries. In addition, the NFL did not have a free agency system in place then (and one would not be established until 1993).With the uncertain labor situation, the WFL had the opportunity to provide players with a better deal than the established leagues would give them, along with the promise of employment. Davidson's league garnered major publicity when the Toronto Northmen, led by John F. Bassett, signed three Miami Dolphins players, fullback Larry Csonka,[1] halfback Jim Kiick, and wide receiver Paul Warfield[4] to what was then the richest three-player deal in sports, an astounding US$3.5 million to start in 1975. The pact was a guaranteed, personal-services contract, so the trio would be paid even if the WFL did not survive its first season.\n The NFL took notice, as did their players when they were approached to jump leagues. The Oakland Raiders nearly lost both their quarterbacks. Ken Stabler[1] signed with the Birmingham Americans, and Daryle Lamonica penned a contract to play for the Southern California Sun starting in 1975. John Wilbur left the Over-the-Hill Gang as a Washington Redskin to invest, coach special teams, and play for the Hawaiians. The Dallas Cowboys also took roster hits when WFL teams in Hawaii and Houston signed running back Calvin Hill and quarterback Craig Morton respectively. The Hawaiians also signed Minnesota Vikings Pro Bowl WR John Gilliam and San Francisco 49ers All-Pro TE Ted Kwalick: however, Gilliam ended up with the Chicago Winds and Kwalick signed with the Philadelphia Bell prior to the 1975 season.By early June 1974, the WFL claimed they had some 60 NFL players under contract. Many of these defections came in the form of futures contracts. The players would play out their existing deals with the NFL, then jump to the WFL when those deals expired. Thus, Stabler would stay with the Raiders through 1975, then would have joined Birmingham in 1976 had the team and league survived that long."

Lord Justice McFarlane reported today that it is 'very tricky to understand' how someone with Khoo Kay Peng's fortune had 'cash flow problem' after he claimed he needed a month to borrow money and pay Pauline Chai. Chai reckons Dr Khoo is worth at least £440 million and says she should get half of that. She also said he failed to provide 'adequate accounting' of his assets, which Dr Khoo disputes. And she said Dr Khoo is making a 'desperate attempt' to avoid a fight over money in an English court. Several judges have considered the dispute at hearings at the Family Division of the London High Court, and three judges at the Court of Appeal are expected to consider the case at a hearing in July. Lord Justice McFarlane today considered a number of preliminary legal issues prior to this hearing."

Railway tracks between Fargo and Wahpeton were covered with water in spots and traffic was suspended. By April 2 the Buffalo River overflowed so a large lake was formed between Glyndon and Moorhead. The Wild Rice (N. Dak.) River was described as 'on a splurge too'. The Sheyenne River was reported rising slowly at Valley City on April 3. The Red crested early on the morning of April 7 at Fargo at 34.2 foot stage (present [1952] datum) exceeding the known high levels of 1871, 1873, and 1882. The Sheyenne River, by April 8, was up so high that water flowed overland from it to the Wild Rice River. The flood of 1897 at Fargo covered most of the business and residential areas of the city.The present indications are that we will have high water this spring, as high if not higher, than it was in the spring of 1861. If all reports are true there is more snow on the level now than there was in the spring of 1861. That year the entire valley was flooded from Big Stone Lake to Winnipeg, a distance of more than 300 miles. There are but four men living in the valley now that witnessed the great flood of '61 -- the largest body of fresh water in the world at that time * * * R. M. Probesfield is authority for saying that he, a few days ago, measured the snow in his timber, where it was free from drifting and it measured 5 feet. This measurement is two and one-half feet more snow than we had in 1861. Those facts prove that we will have a greater flood this year than in the history of the valley. Old Settler."

    "The global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2019 was 409.8 parts per million (ppm for short), with a range of uncertainty of plus or minus 0.1 ppm. Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in at least the past 800,000 years.In fact, the last time the atmospheric CO‚öáá amounts were this high was more than 3 million years ago, when temperature was 2¨‚àû–3¨‚àûC (3.6¨‚àû–5.4¨‚àûF) higher than during the pre-industrial era, and sea level was 15–25 meters (50–80 feet) higher than today.Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. According to State of the Climate in 2019 from NOAA and the American Meteorological Society, Global atmospheric carbon dioxide was 409.8 ± 0.1 ppm in 2019, a new record high. That is an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm from 2018, the same as the increase between 2017 and 2018. In the 1960s, the global growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.6 ± 0.1 ppm per year. Between 2009-18, however, the growth rate has been 2.3 ppm per year. The annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Warmed by sunlight, Earth's land and ocean surfaces continuously radiate thermal infrared energy (heat). Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb that heat and release it gradually over time, like bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out. Without this natural greenhouse effect, Earth's average annual temperature would be below freezing instead of close to 60¨‚àûF. But increases in greenhouse gases have tipped the Earth's energy budget out of balance, trapping additional heat and raising Earth's average temperature."

    "Addison's disease is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system erroneously attacks the adrenal glands degrading the external layer. The condition occurs in only about 1-person per 100,000 but happens at all age levels in men and women. Addison's disease develops when the adrenal glands produce too little cortisol and inadequate levels of aldosterone, severely impacting your health. The adverse condition is often confused with adrenal insufficiency and if left untreated, can be life-threatening. The adrenal glands are positioned just above the kidneys. When these organs are damaged, it affects your endocrine system, disrupting hormone production. Hormones are vital and used to signal instructions to every tissue and organ in the body. The interior of your adrenal glands, known as the medulla, generate adrenaline hormones while the outer layer, known as the cortex, produces corticosteroids. Certain corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids are essential for life. Treatment for Addison's disease requires hormone replacement therapy to balance the body's levels of adrenaline and return to a healthy baseline level. Here are 12 signs of Addison's disease, if you display any of the symptoms, consult with a medical professional."

    "The global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2019 was 409.8 parts per million (ppm for short), with a range of uncertainty of plus or minus 0.1 ppm. Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in at least the past 800,000 years.In fact, the last time the atmospheric CO‚öáá amounts were this high was more than 3 million years ago, when temperature was 2¨‚àû–3¨‚àûC (3.6¨‚àû–5.4¨‚àûF) higher than during the pre-industrial era, and sea level was 15–25 meters (50–80 feet) higher than today.Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. According to State of the Climate in 2019 from NOAA and the American Meteorological Society, Global atmospheric carbon dioxide was 409.8 ± 0.1 ppm in 2019, a new record high. That is an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm from 2018, the same as the increase between 2017 and 2018. In the 1960s, the global growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.6 ± 0.1 ppm per year. Between 2009-18, however, the growth rate has been 2.3 ppm per year. The annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Warmed by sunlight, Earth's land and ocean surfaces continuously radiate thermal infrared energy (heat). Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb that heat and release it gradually over time, like bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out. Without this natural greenhouse effect, Earth's average annual temperature would be below freezing instead of close to 60¨‚àûF. But increases in greenhouse gases have tipped the Earth's energy budget out of balance, trapping additional heat and raising Earth's average temperature."

    "Britain's power plants are still releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases, while households face a tax hike aimed at reducing emissions. Escalating pollution levels occur when the average family is forced to contribute £112 in green taxes each year. The UK is one of only four European countries to have increased pollution from energy production, with only Malta getting worse. The other 23 EU nations have managed to cut emissions from energy companies. Carbon dioxide is responsible for more than 80 percent of Britain's total greenhouse gas emissions. With 40 percent of emissions coming from the energy sector and just 15 percent coming from homes, critics say focusing on households while increasing output from power plants is futile. In 2011, Britain made the biggest emission cuts in the EU, reducing total greenhouse gas production by 40 million tonnes, down 7 percent. Earlier this week, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said he will push the EU to adopt the toughest green targets in the world. He said he would pursue a legally binding target to cut collective greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 50% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels."

Influenza is transmitted through the air from the respiratory tract of an infected person when they talk, cough, or sneeze. It can also be transmitted by touching a surface that has respiratory droplets with influenza viruses and then touching the nose, mouth, or possibly eyes. Typical influenza disease is characterized by sudden onset of fever, aching muscles, sore throat, and nonproductive cough. Additional symptoms may include runny nose, headache, a burning sensation in the chest, and eye pain and sensitivity to light. Typical influenza disease does not occur in every infected person. Someone who has been previously exposed to similar virus strains (through natural infection or vaccination) is less likely to develop serious clinical illness. Not everyone with influenza illness has a fever, especially older adults. Some people may also have nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; these symptoms are more often seen in children."

Escalating pollution levels occur when the average family is forced to contribute £112 in green taxes each year. The UK is one of only four European countries to have increased pollution from energy production, with only Malta getting worse. The other 23 EU nations have managed to cut emissions from energy companies. Carbon dioxide is responsible for more than 80 percent of Britain's total greenhouse gas emissions. With 40 percent of emissions coming from the energy sector and just 15 percent coming from homes, critics say focusing on households while increasing output from power plants is futile. In 2011, Britain made the biggest emission cuts in the EU, reducing total greenhouse gas production by 40 million tonnes, down 7 percent.

    "Addison's disease is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system erroneously attacks the adrenal glands degrading the external layer. The condition occurs in only about 1-person per 100,000 but happens at all age levels in men and women. Addison's disease develops when the adrenal glands produce too little cortisol and inadequate levels of aldosterone, severely impacting your health. The adverse condition is often confused with adrenal insufficiency and if left untreated, can be life-threatening. The adrenal glands are positioned just above the kidneys. When these organs are damaged, it affects your endocrine system, disrupting hormone production. Hormones are vital and used to signal instructions to every tissue and organ in the body. The interior of your adrenal glands, known as the medulla, generate adrenaline hormones while the outer layer, known as the cortex, produces corticosteroids. Certain corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids are essential for life. Treatment for Addison's disease requires hormone replacement therapy to balance the body's levels of adrenaline and return to a healthy baseline level. Here are 12 signs of Addison's disease, if you display any of the symptoms, consult with a medical professional."

For the first time, University of Pennsylvania research based on experimental data connects Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram use to decreased well-being. Psychologist Melissa G. Hunt published her findings in the December Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology.To that end, the research team, which included recent alumni Rachel Marx and Courtney Lipson and Penn senior Jordyn Young, designed their experiment to include the three platforms most popular with a cohort of undergraduates, and then collected objective usage data automatically tracked by iPhones for active apps, not those running the background.Each of 143 participants completed a survey to determine mood and well-being at the study's start, plus shared shots of their iPhone battery screens to offer a week's worth of baseline social-media data. Participants were then randomly assigned to a control group, which had users maintain their typical social-media behavior, or an experimental group that limited time on Facebook, Snapchat, and Instagram to 10 minutes per platform per day.For the next three weeks, participants shared iPhone battery screenshots to give the researchers weekly tallies for each individual. With those data in hand, Hunt then looked at seven outcome measures including fear of missing out, anxiety, depression, and loneliness."

Clinton argued that in the 52 years since 1961, during which Republicans held the House for twenty eight years and the Democrats for 24, the latter produced 42 million jobs compared to the former's 24 million, and despite the small numerical discrepancies, Clinton's ratio held water. Many wondered if Romney would be responsible for Medicare's bankruptcy by 2016, but Republicans have been disadvantaged by the recessions that plagued their administrations. Clinton's ratio is more like 44.7 million jobs to 23.3 million, but there still remains significant controversy amongst economists over proper praise or blame with regard to job creation under Republican or Democratic administrations."

But 2021 has begun with a ray of hope: The beginning of vaccination drive around the world against COVID-19 is expected to gradually bring life back to some semblance of normalcy, and strengthen economic activity in a backdrop of supportive policy stance by most nations. The optimism is reflected in the projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). After a contraction of 3.5% in 2020, IMF expects the global economy to grow 5.5% in 2021 and 4.2% in 2022. The impact of COVID-19 has been severe across nations; however, nations are gradually working to recover.With a growth expectation of 11.5% in 2021, India is projected to be the fastest-growing trillion-dollar economy in the world. The decision to impose a complete lockdown in the first half of 2020 to combat the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a near-halt of its economic activities. Its negative impact was evident in two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, as a result of which India entered into a technical recession for the first time in its history. Overall, the country witnessed a contraction of 8% during 2020 according to the IMF. However, this is a temporary phase, and India is still a compelling growth story.The Union Budget presented on February 1, 2021 brought cheer to the markets and promises to focus on growth. Commending the Government of India on its Union Budget 2021-22, USISPF President and CEO Mukesh Aghi said, \"The Union Budget 2021-22 has taken into consideration the needs of all sectors of the economy, reflecting a robust growth plan for India to become a $5 trillion economy.

    "Local redwood forests are crucial in providing a healthy, stable climate. Studies show that coast redwoods capture more carbon dioxide (CO2) from our cars, trucks, and power plants than any other tree on Earth. Through the process of photosynthesis, redwood trees transform carbon dioxide – the leading cause of accelerating climate change ‚öÑÆ into the oxygen we breathe.When redwoods are cut down, burned, or degraded by human actions, they release much of their stored carbon back into the atmosphere. And, they can no longer transform CO2 into the oxygen we breathe. This is a double-whammy for the growing imbalance in the world's carbon cycle and the climate's stability. Deforestation and other destructive land use account for nearly 25% of carbon dioxide emissions around the world."

In reality, fingerprints can be useful in solving a crime, but only if there is sufficient detail on the prints or partial prints left behind for classification purposes, and then only if the prints belong to someone who has already been previously arrested and fingerprinted to make a comparison match. Otherwise, they are of no immediate value. How about confessions of the accused? Confessions are, indeed, of great value when they can be legally obtained. However, they must be freely and voluntarily given, and then only after the accused has been advised of his constitutional rights per the Miranda ruling. The accused is not required to make, and cannot be compelled to make, confessions or admissions of any kind, nor can they be questioned without a lawyer present if they ask for one. An arrest occurs when a person, usually a law enforcement officer, uses legal authority to restrict a suspect's freedom of movement. Probable cause is the key issue in the arrest process. The police need probable cause to make an arrest or obtain an arrest warrant from a judge.Generally, probable cause requires more than mere suspicion that a suspect committed a crime but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Probable cause is a reasonable belief in the suspect's guilt, based on the facts and information prior to the arrest."

Escalating pollution levels occur when the average family is forced to contribute £112 in green taxes each year. The UK is one of only four European countries to have increased pollution from energy production, with only Malta getting worse. The other 23 EU nations have managed to cut emissions from energy companies. Carbon dioxide is responsible for more than 80 percent of Britain's total greenhouse gas emissions. With 40 percent of emissions coming from the energy sector and just 15 percent coming from homes, critics say focusing on households while increasing output from power plants is futile. In 2011, Britain made the biggest emission cuts in the EU, reducing total greenhouse gas production by 40 million tonnes, down 7 percent. Earlier this week, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said he will push the EU to adopt the toughest green targets in the world. He said he would pursue a legally binding target to cut collective greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 50% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels."

While influenza A viruses infect humans and other animals, influenza B viruses affects only humans. Influenza is transmitted through the air from the respiratory tract of an infected person when they talk, cough, or sneeze. It can also be transmitted by touching a surface that has respiratory droplets with influenza viruses and then touching the nose, mouth, or possibly eyes. Typical influenza disease is characterized by sudden onset of fever, aching muscles, sore throat, and nonproductive cough. Additional symptoms may include runny nose, headache, a burning sensation in the chest, and eye pain and sensitivity to light. Typical influenza disease does not occur in every infected person. Someone who has been previously exposed to similar virus strains (through natural infection or vaccination) is less likely to develop serious clinical illness. Not everyone with influenza illness has a fever, especially older adults. Some people may also have nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; these symptoms are more often seen in children."

    "Local redwood forests are crucial in providing a healthy, stable climate. Studies show that coast redwoods capture more carbon dioxide (CO2) from our cars, trucks, and power plants than any other tree on Earth. Through the process of photosynthesis, redwood trees transform carbon dioxide – the leading cause of accelerating climate change ‚öÑÆ into the oxygen we breathe.When redwoods are cut down, burned, or degraded by human actions, they release much of their stored carbon back into the atmosphere. And, they can no longer transform CO2 into the oxygen we breathe. This is a double-whammy for the growing imbalance in the world's carbon cycle and the climate's stability. Deforestation and other destructive land use account for nearly 25% of carbon dioxide emissions around the world."

    "Pricing needs to match your target market To sum up, pricing is one of the most important aspects of your market strategy, which also includes promotion, placement (or distribution) and people. ‚öÑ∫It's important when you are considering your price that you realize it is not for yourself, but for your target customers,‚öÑπ says Dolansky. Many times, two different stores carry the same product, but one store prices it higher because of the store's perceived higher image. Neckties are often priced using a strategy known as price lining, or price levels.The goal is to get as much of the market as possible to try the product. Penetration pricing is used on many new food products, health and beauty supplies, and paper products sold in grocery stores and mass merchandise stores such as Walmart, Target, and Kmart. Another approach companies use when they introduce a new product is everyday low prices.‚öÑ∫It's important when you are considering your price that you realize it is not for yourself, but for your target customers"
