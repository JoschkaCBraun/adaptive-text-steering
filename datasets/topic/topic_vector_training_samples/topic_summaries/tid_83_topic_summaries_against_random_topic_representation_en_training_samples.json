    "The photographs in the multimedia tab are of Red River flooding in Fargo, North Dakota, in 1897. The U.S. Geological Survey established a gage in 1901. Therefore, the flood of 1897 is outside the USGS period of record. However, other records from 1897 indicated that the flood of April 7, 1897, reached a stage of 40.10 feet present datum, discharge, 25,000 ft3/s at a site 1.5 miles downstream from the present Fargo gage.The flood forecast by \"Old Settler\" was not long delayed. The Red crested at Wahpeton on March 31, 2' 8\" above the 1893 high. By April 1, 1897, the C. M. St. P. & P. Railway tracks between Fargo and Wahpeton were covered with water in spots and traffic was suspended. By April 2 the Buffalo River overflowed so a large lake was formed between Glyndon and Moorhead. The Wild Rice (N. Dak.) River was described as 'on a splurge too'. The Sheyenne River was reported rising slowly at Valley City on April 3. The Red crested early on the morning of April 7 at Fargo at 34.2 foot stage (present [1952] datum) exceeding the known high levels of 1871, 1873, and 1882. The Sheyenne River, by April 8, was up so high that water flowed overland from it to the Wild Rice River. The flood of 1897 at Fargo covered most of the business and residential areas of the city.The present indications are that we will have high water this spring, as high if not higher, than it was in the spring of 1861. If all reports are true there is more snow on the level now than there was in the spring of 1861. That year the entire valley was flooded from Big Stone Lake to Winnipeg, a distance of more than 300 miles. There are but four men living in the valley now that witnessed the great flood of '61 -- the largest body of fresh water in the world at that time * * * R. M. Probesfield is authority for saying that he, a few days ago, measured the snow in his timber, where it was free from drifting and it measured 5 feet. This measurement is two and one-half feet more snow than we had in 1861. Those facts prove that we will have a greater flood this year than in the history of the valley. Old Settler."

    "Family and marriage may at first seem to be familiar topics. Families exist in all societies and they are part of what makes us human. However, societies around the world demonstrate tremendous variation in cultural understandings of family and marriage. Ideas about how people are related to each other, what kind of marriage would be ideal, when people should have children, who should care for children, and many other family related matters differ cross-culturally. While the function of families is to fulfill basic human needs such as providing for children, defining parental roles, regulating sexuality, and passing property and knowledge between generations, there are many variations or patterns of family life that can meet these needs. This chapter introduces some of the more common patterns of family life found around the world. It is important to remember that within any cultural framework variation does occur. Some variations on the standard pattern fall within what would be culturally considered the ‚öÑ∫range of acceptable alternatives.‚öÑπ Other family forms are not entirely accepted, but would still be recognized by most members of the community as reasonable."

Although these highways and interstates may have some segments with designated speeds, they generally have posted speed limits as follows:American law follows the basic idea that most people are reasonable and laws exist to control the few who are unreasonable or inconsiderate. The posted speed zones follow the same idea.Studies performed in Oregon and throughout the United States serve as the basis for how we establish speed zones.

The posted speed zones follow the same idea.Studies performed in Oregon and throughout the United States serve as the basis for how we establish speed zones.

Escalating pollution levels occur when the average family is forced to contribute £112 in green taxes each year. The UK is one of only four European countries to have increased pollution from energy production, with only Malta getting worse. The other 23 EU nations have managed to cut emissions from energy companies. Carbon dioxide is responsible for more than 80 percent of Britain's total greenhouse gas emissions. With 40 percent of emissions coming from the energy sector and just 15 percent coming from homes, critics say focusing on households while increasing output from power plants is futile. In 2011, Britain made the biggest emission cuts in the EU, reducing total greenhouse gas production by 40 million tonnes, down 7 percent. Earlier this week, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said he will push the EU to adopt the toughest green targets in the world. He said he would pursue a legally binding target to cut collective greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 50% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels."

    "The Criminal Justice system can be a complicated system to follow. For a crime victim and/or witness who is also coping with the crime and its effects, the entire process can be difficult and stressful.Further complicating matters is the fact that, once there is a conviction and the case is thought to be finished, the defendant ordinarily has the right to appeal.An appeal from a judgment in a federal criminal case is a request by the losing party to have the federal Court of Appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court review the decisions made in the district court. Many of the issues raised on appeal concern how the district court judge managed a trial or plea, or ruled at sentencing. In most criminal cases, an appeal is brought by a defendant after a court or jury finds him or her guilty.Appeals by the government are limited by the United States Constitution. The 5th Amendment's ‚öÑ∫double jeopardy‚öÑπ clause protects against multiple prosecutions for the same offense. Therefore, if the defendant is acquitted, the government cannot appeal.\n There are limited instances, however, when the government can appeal. The government may appeal court rulings which grant a defendant post-conviction relief (e.g., the reversal of a conviction). It may also appeal district court decisions on certain pre-trial motions (e.g., the suppression of evidence and sentencing issues).Appeals arising out of cases from the Federal district courts of Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana are handled by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, located in Chicago, Illinois. Criminal appellate procedure involves a set of rules and time limits which guide a case through the appellate process. This process begins when a defendant convicted at the district court level files a ‚öÑ∫Notice of Appeal.‚öÑπ The defendant's notice of appeal must usually be filed within ten days following the district court's entry of judgment. If the government is appealing the district court's decision, a timely notice of appeal may be filed within thirty days following entry of judgment.The defendant, now referred to as the ‚öÑ∫appellant,‚öÑπ must file an ‚öÑ∫appellant's brief.‚öÑπ A brief is a written legal argument which conveys the case to the court. On the average, it takes several months for a case to move from sentencing to the filing of the appellant's brief.The government then responds to the appellant's brief by filing an ‚öÑ∫appellee's‚öÑπ brief approximately thirty days thereafter. The appellee's brief is an answer to the challenge made by the defendant. The defendant may, within fourteen days thereafter, file an ‚öÑ∫appellant's reply brief‚öÑπ before the Court of Appeals considers the case.In most cases, following briefing, oral arguments are scheduled before a panel of three judges. An oral argument is an opportunity for each party's attorney to persuade the court and answer any questions from the judges. The argument, regarding the issues raised, usually lasts a total of 20 to 30 minutes. Only attorneys may address the court during oral arguments. Victims and/or witnesses may attend an oral argument which is open to the public. The defendant will not be present if he or she is in prison.After the Court of Appeals receives the briefs and has heard arguments, it may take several months or more to make a decision. Ultimately, the appellate court's final decision will either"

This will pave the way for others, who do not use Apple devices, to develop similar apps of their own, and to obtain a wider group of cell phone users.",

    "COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breathes out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus. These droplets and particles can be breathed in by other people or land on their eyes, noses, or mouth. In some circumstances, they may contaminate surfaces they touch. People who are closer than 6 feet from the infected person are most likely to get infected.Fifth disease is a mild rash illness caused by parvovirus B19. It is more common in children than adults. A person usually gets sick with fifth disease within 14 days after getting infected with parvovirus B19. This disease, also called erythema infectiosum, got its name because it was fifth in a list of historical classifications of common skin rash illnesses in children.Some people may get a second rash a few days later on their chest, back, buttocks, or arms and legs. The rash may be itchy, especially on the soles of the feet. It can vary in intensity and usually goes away in seven to 10 days, but it can come and go for several weeks. As it starts to go away, it may look lacy.People with fifth disease can also develop pain and swelling in their joints. This is called polyarthropathy syndrome. It is more common in adults, especially women. Some adults with fifth disease may only have painful joints, usually in the hands, feet, or knees, and no other symptoms. The joint pain usually lasts 1 to 3 weeks, but it can last for months or longer. It usually goes away without any long-term problems."

    "A fingerprint is an impression left by the friction ridges of a human finger. The recovery of partial fingerprints from a crime scene is an important method of forensic science. Moisture and grease on a finger result in fingerprints on surfaces such as glass or metal. Deliberate impressions of entire fingerprints can be obtained by ink or other substances transferred from the peaks of friction ridges on the skin to a smooth surface such as paper. Fingerprint records normally contain impressions from the pad on the last joint of fingers and thumbs, though fingerprint cards also typically record portions of lower joint areas of the fingers."

    "The fledgling WFL did succeed in raising stagnant salaries in the NFL. Average salaries in professional football were among the lowest in the four major North American sports, and the National Football League Players Association and the Canadian Football League Players Association had both gone on strike prior to their leagues' respective 1974 seasons in an effort to lift many of the rules suppressing free agency and player salaries. In addition, the NFL did not have a free agency system in place then (and one would not be established until 1993).With the uncertain labor situation, the WFL had the opportunity to provide players with a better deal than the established leagues would give them, along with the promise of employment. Davidson's league garnered major publicity when the Toronto Northmen, led by John F. Bassett, signed three Miami Dolphins players, fullback Larry Csonka,[1] halfback Jim Kiick, and wide receiver Paul Warfield[4] to what was then the richest three-player deal in sports, an astounding US$3.5 million to start in 1975. The pact was a guaranteed, personal-services contract, so the trio would be paid even if the WFL did not survive its first season.\n The NFL took notice, as did their players when they were approached to jump leagues. The Oakland Raiders nearly lost both their quarterbacks. Ken Stabler[1] signed with the Birmingham Americans, and Daryle Lamonica penned a contract to play for the Southern California Sun starting in 1975. John Wilbur left the Over-the-Hill Gang as a Washington Redskin to invest, coach special teams, and play for the Hawaiians. The Dallas Cowboys also took roster hits when WFL teams in Hawaii and Houston signed running back Calvin Hill and quarterback Craig Morton respectively. The Hawaiians also signed Minnesota Vikings Pro Bowl WR John Gilliam and San Francisco 49ers All-Pro TE Ted Kwalick: however, Gilliam ended up with the Chicago Winds and Kwalick signed with the Philadelphia Bell prior to the 1975 season.By early June 1974, the WFL claimed they had some 60 NFL players under contract. Many of these defections came in the form of futures contracts. The players would play out their existing deals with the NFL, then jump to the WFL when those deals expired. Thus, Stabler would stay with the Raiders through 1975, then would have joined Birmingham in 1976 had the team and league survived that long."

    "Influenza is caused by influenza viruses. Two types of influenza, A and B, cause outbreaks in people. Both types can cause mild to severe illness in all age groups. While influenza A viruses infect humans and other animals, influenza B viruses affects only humans. Influenza is transmitted through the air from the respiratory tract of an infected person when they talk, cough, or sneeze. It can also be transmitted by touching a surface that has respiratory droplets with influenza viruses and then touching the nose, mouth, or possibly eyes. Typical influenza disease is characterized by sudden onset of fever, aching muscles, sore throat, and nonproductive cough. Additional symptoms may include runny nose, headache, a burning sensation in the chest, and eye pain and sensitivity to light. Typical influenza disease does not occur in every infected person. Someone who has been previously exposed to similar virus strains (through natural infection or vaccination) is less likely to develop serious clinical illness. Not everyone with influenza illness has a fever, especially older adults. Some people may also have nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; these symptoms are more often seen in children."

She managed – with very hard work and discipline – to drop a whopping 7 stones, just from sticking to her diet and exercise regiment. Unfortunately,her flabby arms would not budge a bit and stayed just as large as they were at her heaviest weight, taking away much of her sense of pride and ability to show off what she had accomplished with her discipline and determination. She decided to go to a surgeon in Brussels, who made her feel very comfortable and promised to remove the fat from her arms. Unfortunately, the surgeon – who charged her £3,500 – was discovered a time afterwards to have removed absolutely no fat at all. In fact, he more than likely permanently scarred her arms up terribly, and she had nothing to show for it. She was told to wait a couple weeks and they would be ‚öÑπnormal,‚öÑπ but they never did. Dr. Peter Arnstein, a British consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon, was dismayed by Marcia's story and deicded to help her. He helped her get her body back to normal and she is very grateful to be able to wear clothes that her entire body fits in now instead of ones that only fit her arms."

Distractions on the road result in many vehicular accidents; among, of which, are slower reaction times in traffic situations. Texting is especially dangerous when traveling at a high rate of speed.

This will pave the way for others, who do not use Apple devices, to develop similar apps of their own, and to obtain a wider group of cell phone users.",

If all reports are true there is more snow on the level now than there was in the spring of 1861. That year the entire valley was flooded from Big Stone Lake to Winnipeg, a distance of more than 300 miles. There are but four men living in the valley now that witnessed the great flood of '61 -- the largest body of fresh water in the world at that time * * * R. M. Probesfield is authority for saying that he, a few days ago, measured the snow in his timber, where it was free from drifting and it measured 5 feet. This measurement is two and one-half feet more snow than we had in 1861. Those facts prove that we will have a greater flood this year than in the history of the valley. Old Settler.The flood forecast by \"Old Settler\" was not long delayed. The Red crested at Wahpeton on March 31, 2' 8\" above the 1893 high. By April 1, 1897, the C. M. St. P. & P. Railway tracks between Fargo and Wahpeton were covered with water in spots and traffic was suspended. By April 2 the Buffalo River overflowed so a large lake was formed between Glyndon and Moorhead. The Wild Rice (N. Dak.) River was described as 'on a splurge too'. The Sheyenne River was reported rising slowly at Valley City on April 3. The Red crested early on the morning of April 7 at Fargo at 34.2 foot stage (present [1952] datum) exceeding the known high levels of 1871, 1873, and 1882. The Sheyenne River, by April 8, was up so high that water flowed overland from it to the Wild Rice River. The flood of 1897 at Fargo covered most of the business and residential areas of the city."

    "Bill Clinton spoke to the DNC in Charlotte, North Carolina, garnering a large applause when he claimed Democratic administrations produced twice as many jobs as Republican administrations. Postulating the argument that Democratic administrations produced 42 million jobs relative to the Republican administration's 24 million over the past fifty two years, Clinton claimed Democratic administrations produce twice as many jobs as Republican administrations. Although there is a small discrepancy, for Democratic administrations produced a 44.7 million increase in jobs, whereas the Republicans produced 23.3 million. The Republicans were disadvantaged by frequent recessions, with only one of six occurring during a Democratic presidency. The Democratic administrations were advantaged by population growth in the past two decades, and Clinton's presidency itself occurred during a large growth period in the US economy. Despite the fact that economists frequently debate which administrations are to blame--or to praise--for respective economic decline or growth, and despite Clinton's minor discrepancies, his argument holds water against fact checks."

While the function of families is to fulfill basic human needs such as providing for children, defining parental roles, regulating sexuality, and passing property and knowledge between generations, there are many variations or patterns of family life that can meet these needs. This chapter introduces some of the more common patterns of family life found around the world."

The drop in repairs, and funneling of traffic to try and mitigate the damage of heavy flow on old structures will cause delays this summer. If funds are found, you may find yourself stopped in traffic waiting on road crews, but if it is not, you may find yourself stopped in traffic waiting on bottlenecks as traffic is diverted to help extend the life of aging structures.",

It is understood that for a restaurant with a capacity for around 30 diners, around 550 kg of firewood would be burned during peak periods, which would have a huge impact on air quality. Some restaurants in Kunming have already gone for greener options, with one restaurant on Guannan Road using the greener charcoal option. The SouthAsia Garden Firewood Chicken restaurant naturally uses gas and serves the dish in clay pots to give it an authentic taste."

    "A boss of Laura Ashley has been ordered to pay £400,000 to his former beauty queen wife because he has not been able to get a judge that he has 'cash flow' problems. Lord Justice McFarlane reported today that it is 'very tricky to understand' how someone with Khoo Kay Peng's fortune had 'cash flow problem' after he claimed he needed a month to borrow money and pay Pauline Chai. Chai reckons Dr Khoo is worth at least £440 million and says she should get half of that. She also said he failed to provide 'adequate accounting' of his assets, which Dr Khoo disputes. And she said Dr Khoo is making a 'desperate attempt' to avoid a fight over money in an English court. Several judges have considered the dispute at hearings at the Family Division of the London High Court, and three judges at the Court of Appeal are expected to consider the case at a hearing in July. Lord Justice McFarlane today considered a number of preliminary legal issues prior to this hearing."

Health services are not the only edge these Eastern European countries have over Britain, as expressed by a 15-year-old Lithuanian girl who wants to be a dentist, but is encountering roadblocks due to the teachers underestimating her competency. Parents of these Eastern European children also feel their children are insufficiently challenged academically, working far below their academic level compared to what they would be studying in the maths and sciences in their home countries.

See OAR 734-020-0011 for all designated speeds.In addition, Oregon Revised Statute (ORS 811.111 subsection 2-12) establishes different statutory speeds than those shown above for specific sections of rural highways and interstates in eastern Oregon. Although these highways and interstates may have some segments with designated speeds, they generally have posted speed limits as follows:American law follows the basic idea that most people are reasonable and laws exist to control the few who are unreasonable or inconsiderate. The posted speed zones follow the same idea.Studies performed in Oregon and throughout the United States serve as the basis for how we establish speed zones. These studies show that traffic moving at a speed reasonable for the road and weather conditions results in fewer crashes. Drivers are more patient because a reasonably uniform speed allows progress with less passing, less delay, and fewer rear-end collisions.",

Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the match."

    "Eastern European nations--like Poland--that joined the European Union in 2004 after their previous communistic eras that lasted until the 1990s have produced 1.5 million migrant workers in Britain. Despite their economic struggles relative to non-communist Britain, these countries are found to provide superior public services when compared to Britain, as in the case of an 11-year-old Polish girl who had to be flown back home to Poland to get dental work done in one weekend that would have otherwise taken the NHS four months to schedule an appointment. Health services are not the only edge these Eastern European countries have over Britain, as expressed by a 15-year-old Lithuanian girl who wants to be a dentist, but is encountering roadblocks due to the teachers underestimating her competency. Parents of these Eastern European children also feel their children are insufficiently challenged academically, working far below their academic level compared to what they would be studying in the maths and sciences in their home countries. Listening to these voices is necessary to determine what provisions must be made to support migrant families in the European Union."

    "Although most interstates have a statutory speed of 55 mph for trucks, many of these interstates have designated truck speeds of 60 mph by Oregon Administrative Rule. See OAR 734-020-0011 for all designated speeds.In addition, Oregon Revised Statute (ORS 811.111 subsection 2-12) establishes different statutory speeds than those shown above for specific sections of rural highways and interstates in eastern Oregon. Although these highways and interstates may have some segments with designated speeds, they generally have posted speed limits as follows:American law follows the basic idea that most people are reasonable and laws exist to control the few who are unreasonable or inconsiderate. The posted speed zones follow the same idea.Studies performed in Oregon and throughout the United States serve as the basis for how we establish speed zones. These studies show that traffic moving at a speed reasonable for the road and weather conditions results in fewer crashes. Drivers are more patient because a reasonably uniform speed allows progress with less passing, less delay, and fewer rear-end collisions.",

The biggest of these shudders arrived at a size of 5.1 off the bank of El Hierro - the littlest island in the Canaries - and the island is said to have expanded by three inches. This expanded again in January 2012, however by March the experts on El Hierro pronounced the emission danger to be finished. Following the multitude of tremors early last week, El Hierro's checking organization raised the volcanic ejection hazard to 'yellow'. Following the ascent in seismic movement in 2011, dull earthy colored magma was spotted off the bank of El Hierro, envisioned left, close to the town of La Restinga. La Restinga was cleared and delivering in the space was prohibited however the action died down by March 2012."

Distractions on the road result in many vehicular accidents; among, of which, are slower reaction times in traffic situations. Texting is especially dangerous when traveling at a high rate of speed. One method Apple is researching, and would be a main focus, is the detection of the speed of the vehicle. \n Blocking of a signal would be for the driver alone.

Barbados started the match needing to win by a margin of at least two goals to qualify for the final tournament, and after Grenada scored late in normal time to bring the scoreline to 2–1, Barbados deliberately scored an own goal to force extra-time, where they could get the two-goal winning margin they needed courtesy of the unconventional golden goal rule.[1] This resulted in an unusual situation: for the last three minutes of the match, Grenada was trying to score in both goals, as either outcome (3–2 or 2–3) would have advanced them to the finals, while Barbados had to defend both goals. Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the match.The 1994 Caribbean Cup was the fifth edition of the Caribbean Cup and was played in Trinidad and Tobago. Qualification took place in various other locations around the Caribbean in early 1994.[3] At the time, FIFA had been testing variations on tournament rules,[4] and the tournament organizers had decided that any matches where the score was tied at the end of the normal 90 minutes would go to extra-time, which would feature a golden goal that, if scored, would be worth two goals.[1] Barbados, Grenada, and Puerto Rico were drawn into Group 1, and on January 23 the round-robin tournament kicked off in Barbados, with the home team falling 0–1 to Puerto Rico. Two days later, Grenada defeated Puerto Rico 2–0 after a golden goal in extra-time. This put Grenada at the top of the group with three points and a +2 goal difference.[3] Thus, the only way that Barbados could advance to the finals would be if they could beat Grenada by a margin of at least two goals."

    "Influenza is caused by influenza viruses. Two types of influenza, A and B, cause outbreaks in people. Both types can cause mild to severe illness in all age groups. While influenza A viruses infect humans and other animals, influenza B viruses affects only humans. Influenza is transmitted through the air from the respiratory tract of an infected person when they talk, cough, or sneeze. It can also be transmitted by touching a surface that has respiratory droplets with influenza viruses and then touching the nose, mouth, or possibly eyes. Typical influenza disease is characterized by sudden onset of fever, aching muscles, sore throat, and nonproductive cough. Additional symptoms may include runny nose, headache, a burning sensation in the chest, and eye pain and sensitivity to light. Typical influenza disease does not occur in every infected person. Someone who has been previously exposed to similar virus strains (through natural infection or vaccination) is less likely to develop serious clinical illness. Not everyone with influenza illness has a fever, especially older adults. Some people may also have nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; these symptoms are more often seen in children."

A super-spring of gushing lava ejection could significantly affect the worldwide environment.The Mount Pinatubo emission in 1992, which was multiple times more fragile than the notable super-spring of gushing lava ejection that happened 600,000 years prior in what is presently Yellowstone National Park, diminished the worldwide temperature by 0.4¨‚àûC for a couple of months. The forecasts for a super well of lava are a fall in temperatures by 10¨‚àûC across the world for a very long time. Nonetheless, emissions just occur like clockwork or somewhere in the vicinity and Dr Malfait said: It's not something that we should stress over in our own lives."

    "Since the repeal of the 55 mph national maximum speed limit on US interstatehighways, speed limits have been raised across the country to as high as 75 mph and more.While many studies have addressed the effects of increased speeds on accident frequencyand severity, the factors that determine drivers' choice of speed in the presence of speedlimits are still not well understood. This paper provides additional insight into drivers'choice of speed by using a survey of Indiana drivers. The survey is timely since Indianarecently raised speed limits on rural interstates to 70 mph. With urban and suburban areasincluded, interstate speed limits in the state are now 55 mph, 65 mph and 70 mph. Usingseemingly unrelated regression estimation, models of normal interstate driving speeds with low-traffic conditions are estimated for 55 mph, 65 mph and 70 mph speed limits.",

    "The fledgling WFL did succeed in raising stagnant salaries in the NFL. Average salaries in professional football were among the lowest in the four major North American sports, and the National Football League Players Association and the Canadian Football League Players Association had both gone on strike prior to their leagues' respective 1974 seasons in an effort to lift many of the rules suppressing free agency and player salaries. In addition, the NFL did not have a free agency system in place then (and one would not be established until 1993).With the uncertain labor situation, the WFL had the opportunity to provide players with a better deal than the established leagues would give them, along with the promise of employment. Davidson's league garnered major publicity when the Toronto Northmen, led by John F. Bassett, signed three Miami Dolphins players, fullback Larry Csonka,[1] halfback Jim Kiick, and wide receiver Paul Warfield[4] to what was then the richest three-player deal in sports, an astounding US$3.5 million to start in 1975. The pact was a guaranteed, personal-services contract, so the trio would be paid even if the WFL did not survive its first season.\n The NFL took notice, as did their players when they were approached to jump leagues. The Oakland Raiders nearly lost both their quarterbacks. Ken Stabler[1] signed with the Birmingham Americans, and Daryle Lamonica penned a contract to play for the Southern California Sun starting in 1975. John Wilbur left the Over-the-Hill Gang as a Washington Redskin to invest, coach special teams, and play for the Hawaiians. The Dallas Cowboys also took roster hits when WFL teams in Hawaii and Houston signed running back Calvin Hill and quarterback Craig Morton respectively. The Hawaiians also signed Minnesota Vikings Pro Bowl WR John Gilliam and San Francisco 49ers All-Pro TE Ted Kwalick: however, Gilliam ended up with the Chicago Winds and Kwalick signed with the Philadelphia Bell prior to the 1975 season.By early June 1974, the WFL claimed they had some 60 NFL players under contract. Many of these defections came in the form of futures contracts. The players would play out their existing deals with the NFL, then jump to the WFL when those deals expired. Thus, Stabler would stay with the Raiders through 1975, then would have joined Birmingham in 1976 had the team and league survived that long."

    "George Osborne today alluded to the chance of future tax reductions as he distributed a report asserting that dropping arranged ascents in fuel obligation has helped the economy by up to £7.5billion. The investigation could infer that the Chancellor means to reduce government expenditures in the following Parliament if the Conservatives figure out how to win a larger part in the 2015 political race. The Treasury study delivered today appraises that the powerful 20% genuine cut in fuel obligation since 2010 will add 0.3 to 0.5 percent to development over the long haul. Clue: George Osborne could utilize a Conservative larger part to curtail government expenditures . The examination, utilizing a model by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, upholds the perspective on supply side financial experts who contend that over the long haul lower expenses will deliver higher income for the Exchequer."

    "Pricing needs to match your target market To sum up, pricing is one of the most important aspects of your market strategy, which also includes promotion, placement (or distribution) and people. ‚öÑ∫It's important when you are considering your price that you realize it is not for yourself, but for your target customers,‚öÑπ says Dolansky. Many times, two different stores carry the same product, but one store prices it higher because of the store's perceived higher image. Neckties are often priced using a strategy known as price lining, or price levels.The goal is to get as much of the market as possible to try the product. Penetration pricing is used on many new food products, health and beauty supplies, and paper products sold in grocery stores and mass merchandise stores such as Walmart, Target, and Kmart. Another approach companies use when they introduce a new product is everyday low prices.‚öÑ∫It's important when you are considering your price that you realize it is not for yourself, but for your target customers"

The Red crested at Wahpeton on March 31, 2' 8\" above the 1893 high. By April 1, 1897, the C. M. St. P. & P. Railway tracks between Fargo and Wahpeton were covered with water in spots and traffic was suspended. By April 2 the Buffalo River overflowed so a large lake was formed between Glyndon and Moorhead. The Wild Rice (N. Dak.) River was described as 'on a splurge too'. The Sheyenne River was reported rising slowly at Valley City on April 3. The Red crested early on the morning of April 7 at Fargo at 34.2 foot stage (present [1952] datum) exceeding the known high levels of 1871, 1873, and 1882. The Sheyenne River, by April 8, was up so high that water flowed overland from it to the Wild Rice River. The flood of 1897 at Fargo covered most of the business and residential areas of the city.The present indications are that we will have high water this spring, as high if not higher, than it was in the spring of 1861. If all reports are true there is more snow on the level now than there was in the spring of 1861. That year the entire valley was flooded from Big Stone Lake to Winnipeg, a distance of more than 300 miles. There are but four men living in the valley now that witnessed the great flood of '61 -- the largest body of fresh water in the world at that time * * * R. M. Probesfield is authority for saying that he, a few days ago, measured the snow in his timber, where it was free from drifting and it measured 5 feet. This measurement is two and one-half feet more snow than we had in 1861. Those facts prove that we will have a greater flood this year than in the history of the valley. Old Settler."

    "Family and marriage may at first seem to be familiar topics. Families exist in all societies and they are part of what makes us human. However, societies around the world demonstrate tremendous variation in cultural understandings of family and marriage. Ideas about how people are related to each other, what kind of marriage would be ideal, when people should have children, who should care for children, and many other family related matters differ cross-culturally. While the function of families is to fulfill basic human needs such as providing for children, defining parental roles, regulating sexuality, and passing property and knowledge between generations, there are many variations or patterns of family life that can meet these needs. This chapter introduces some of the more common patterns of family life found around the world. It is important to remember that within any cultural framework variation does occur. Some variations on the standard pattern fall within what would be culturally considered the ‚öÑ∫range of acceptable alternatives.‚öÑπ Other family forms are not entirely accepted, but would still be recognized by most members of the community as reasonable."

    "Although most interstates have a statutory speed of 55 mph for trucks, many of these interstates have designated truck speeds of 60 mph by Oregon Administrative Rule. See OAR 734-020-0011 for all designated speeds.In addition, Oregon Revised Statute (ORS 811.111 subsection 2-12) establishes different statutory speeds than those shown above for specific sections of rural highways and interstates in eastern Oregon. Although these highways and interstates may have some segments with designated speeds, they generally have posted speed limits as follows:American law follows the basic idea that most people are reasonable and laws exist to control the few who are unreasonable or inconsiderate. The posted speed zones follow the same idea.Studies performed in Oregon and throughout the United States serve as the basis for how we establish speed zones. These studies show that traffic moving at a speed reasonable for the road and weather conditions results in fewer crashes. Drivers are more patient because a reasonably uniform speed allows progress with less passing, less delay, and fewer rear-end collisions.",

    "The fledgling WFL did succeed in raising stagnant salaries in the NFL. Average salaries in professional football were among the lowest in the four major North American sports, and the National Football League Players Association and the Canadian Football League Players Association had both gone on strike prior to their leagues' respective 1974 seasons in an effort to lift many of the rules suppressing free agency and player salaries. In addition, the NFL did not have a free agency system in place then (and one would not be established until 1993).With the uncertain labor situation, the WFL had the opportunity to provide players with a better deal than the established leagues would give them, along with the promise of employment. Davidson's league garnered major publicity when the Toronto Northmen, led by John F. Bassett, signed three Miami Dolphins players, fullback Larry Csonka,[1] halfback Jim Kiick, and wide receiver Paul Warfield[4] to what was then the richest three-player deal in sports, an astounding US$3.5 million to start in 1975. The pact was a guaranteed, personal-services contract, so the trio would be paid even if the WFL did not survive its first season.\n The NFL took notice, as did their players when they were approached to jump leagues. The Oakland Raiders nearly lost both their quarterbacks. Ken Stabler[1] signed with the Birmingham Americans, and Daryle Lamonica penned a contract to play for the Southern California Sun starting in 1975. John Wilbur left the Over-the-Hill Gang as a Washington Redskin to invest, coach special teams, and play for the Hawaiians. The Dallas Cowboys also took roster hits when WFL teams in Hawaii and Houston signed running back Calvin Hill and quarterback Craig Morton respectively. The Hawaiians also signed Minnesota Vikings Pro Bowl WR John Gilliam and San Francisco 49ers All-Pro TE Ted Kwalick: however, Gilliam ended up with the Chicago Winds and Kwalick signed with the Philadelphia Bell prior to the 1975 season.By early June 1974, the WFL claimed they had some 60 NFL players under contract. Many of these defections came in the form of futures contracts. The players would play out their existing deals with the NFL, then jump to the WFL when those deals expired. Thus, Stabler would stay with the Raiders through 1975, then would have joined Birmingham in 1976 had the team and league survived that long."

The 31-year-old German, who is among the tallest and then heaviest riders in the paddock, ran without a bottle of drink at the Malaysian and Bahrain Grand Prix earlier this season to keep his weight to a minimum. But the sport's heaviest riders remain at a disadvantage, as each extra kilogram of weight can cost half a tenth of a second. And speaking ahead of the fifth round of this year's championship in Spain, Sutil admitted that he avoided eating for 48 hours in an attempt to lose weight.\n I tried hard,' said Sutil. Sutil's revelations come after Toro Rosso driver Jean-Eric Vergne admitted he was hospitalized after the season opener in Australia due to a strict diet regimen. 'I could feel that there was a limit where I no longer had the power, the strength in my mind - you get stressed too soon - and you don't want that. It is important to know your body very well."

    "Although most interstates have a statutory speed of 55 mph for trucks, many of these interstates have designated truck speeds of 60 mph by Oregon Administrative Rule. See OAR 734-020-0011 for all designated speeds.In addition, Oregon Revised Statute (ORS 811.111 subsection 2-12) establishes different statutory speeds than those shown above for specific sections of rural highways and interstates in eastern Oregon. Although these highways and interstates may have some segments with designated speeds, they generally have posted speed limits as follows:American law follows the basic idea that most people are reasonable and laws exist to control the few who are unreasonable or inconsiderate. The posted speed zones follow the same idea.Studies performed in Oregon and throughout the United States serve as the basis for how we establish speed zones. These studies show that traffic moving at a speed reasonable for the road and weather conditions results in fewer crashes. Drivers are more patient because a reasonably uniform speed allows progress with less passing, less delay, and fewer rear-end collisions.",
    "The organizers of the tournament had imposed a rule requiring all matches to have a winner, and this was enforced with an unusual variant of the golden goal rule: the first goal scored in extra-time not only won the match, but was also worth two goals. Barbados started the match needing to win by a margin of at least two goals to qualify for the final tournament, and after Grenada scored late in normal time to bring the scoreline to 2–1, Barbados deliberately scored an own goal to force extra-time, where they could get the two-goal winning margin they needed courtesy of the unconventional golden goal rule.[1] This resulted in an unusual situation: for the last three minutes of the match, Grenada was trying to score in both goals, as either outcome (3–2 or 2–3) would have advanced them to the finals, while Barbados had to defend both goals. Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the match."

It can also be transmitted by touching a surface that has respiratory droplets with influenza viruses and then touching the nose, mouth, or possibly eyes. Typical influenza disease is characterized by sudden onset of fever, aching muscles, sore throat, and nonproductive cough. Additional symptoms may include runny nose, headache, a burning sensation in the chest, and eye pain and sensitivity to light. Typical influenza disease does not occur in every infected person. Someone who has been previously exposed to similar virus strains (through natural infection or vaccination) is less likely to develop serious clinical illness. Not everyone with influenza illness has a fever, especially older adults. Some people may also have nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea; these symptoms are more often seen in children."

Escalating pollution levels occur when the average family is forced to contribute £112 in green taxes each year. The UK is one of only four European countries to have increased pollution from energy production, with only Malta getting worse. The other 23 EU nations have managed to cut emissions from energy companies. Carbon dioxide is responsible for more than 80 percent of Britain's total greenhouse gas emissions. With 40 percent of emissions coming from the energy sector and just 15 percent coming from homes, critics say focusing on households while increasing output from power plants is futile. In 2011, Britain made the biggest emission cuts in the EU, reducing total greenhouse gas production by 40 million tonnes, down 7 percent. Earlier this week, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said he will push the EU to adopt the toughest green targets in the world.

This paper provides additional insight into drivers'choice of speed by using a survey of Indiana drivers. The survey is timely since Indianarecently raised speed limits on rural interstates to 70 mph. With urban and suburban areasincluded, interstate speed limits in the state are now 55 mph, 65 mph and 70 mph. Usingseemingly unrelated regression estimation, models of normal interstate driving speeds with low-traffic conditions are estimated for 55 mph, 65 mph and 70 mph speed limits.",

    "ccession to the British throne is determined by descent, sex (males born before 28 October 2011 precede their elder sisters in the line of succession), legitimacy, and religion. Under common law, the Crown is inherited by a sovereign's children or by a childless sovereign's nearest collateral line. The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701 restrict succession to the throne to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover who are in \"communion with the Church of England\".[1] Spouses of Roman Catholics were disqualified from 1689 until the law was amended in 2015. Protestant descendants of those excluded for being Roman Catholics are eligible.[2]\n \n\n Queen Elizabeth II is the sovereign, and her heir apparent is her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales. Next in line after him is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales's elder son. Third in line is Prince George, the eldest child of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, Princess Charlotte, and his younger brother, Prince Louis. Sixth in line is Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, the younger son of the Prince of Wales. Under the Perth Agreement, which came into effect in 2015, only the first six in line of succession require the sovereign's consent before they marry; without such consent, they and their children would be disqualified from succession.\n \n\n The first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21, and the sovereign's consort, may be appointed counsellors of state. Counsellors of state perform some of the sovereign's duties in the United Kingdom while he or she is out of the country or temporarily incapacitated.

Obama's father, Barack Sr., a Kenyan economist, met his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, when both were students in Hawaii, where Barack was born on August 4, 1961. They later divorced, and Barack's mother married a man from Indonesia, where he spent his early childhood. Before fifth grade, he returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents and attend Punahou School on scholarship.In his memoir Dreams from My Father (1995), Obama describes the complexities of discovering his identity in adolescence. After two years at Occidental College in Los Angeles, he transferred to Columbia University, where he studied political science and international relations. Following graduation in 1983, Obama worked in New York City, then became a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago, coordinating with churches to improve housing conditions and set up job-training programs in a community hit hard by steel mill closures. In 1988, he went to Harvard Law School, where he attracted national attention as the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review. Returning to Chicago, he joined a small law firm specializing in civil rights.As an incoming president, Obama faced many challenges‚öÑÆan economic collapse, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the continuing menace of terrorism. Inaugurated before an estimated crowd of 1.8 million people, Obama proposed unprecedented federal spending to revive the economy and also hoped to renew America's stature in the world. During his first term he signed three signature bills: an omnibus bill to stimulate the economy, legislation making health care more accessible and affordable, and legislation reforming the nation's financial institutions. Obama also pressed for a fair pay act for women, financial reform legislation, and efforts for consumer protection. In 2009, Obama became the fourth president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize."
