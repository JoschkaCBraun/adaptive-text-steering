    "The Criminal Justice system can be a complicated system to follow. For a crime victim and/or witness who is also coping with the crime and its effects, the entire process can be difficult and stressful.Further complicating matters is the fact that, once there is a conviction and the case is thought to be finished, the defendant ordinarily has the right to appeal.An appeal from a judgment in a federal criminal case is a request by the losing party to have the federal Court of Appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court review the decisions made in the district court. Many of the issues raised on appeal concern how the district court judge managed a trial or plea, or ruled at sentencing. In most criminal cases, an appeal is brought by a defendant after a court or jury finds him or her guilty.Appeals by the government are limited by the United States Constitution. The 5th Amendment's ‚öÑ∫double jeopardy‚öÑπ clause protects against multiple prosecutions for the same offense. Therefore, if the defendant is acquitted, the government cannot appeal.\n There are limited instances, however, when the government can appeal. The government may appeal court rulings which grant a defendant post-conviction relief (e.g., the reversal of a conviction). It may also appeal district court decisions on certain pre-trial motions (e.g., the suppression of evidence and sentencing issues).Appeals arising out of cases from the Federal district courts of Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana are handled by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, located in Chicago, Illinois. Criminal appellate procedure involves a set of rules and time limits which guide a case through the appellate process. This process begins when a defendant convicted at the district court level files a ‚öÑ∫Notice of Appeal.‚öÑπ The defendant's notice of appeal must usually be filed within ten days following the district court's entry of judgment. If the government is appealing the district court's decision, a timely notice of appeal may be filed within thirty days following entry of judgment.The defendant, now referred to as the ‚öÑ∫appellant,‚öÑπ must file an ‚öÑ∫appellant's brief.‚öÑπ A brief is a written legal argument which conveys the case to the court. On the average, it takes several months for a case to move from sentencing to the filing of the appellant's brief.The government then responds to the appellant's brief by filing an ‚öÑ∫appellee's‚öÑπ brief approximately thirty days thereafter. The appellee's brief is an answer to the challenge made by the defendant. The defendant may, within fourteen days thereafter, file an ‚öÑ∫appellant's reply brief‚öÑπ before the Court of Appeals considers the case.In most cases, following briefing, oral arguments are scheduled before a panel of three judges. An oral argument is an opportunity for each party's attorney to persuade the court and answer any questions from the judges. The argument, regarding the issues raised, usually lasts a total of 20 to 30 minutes. Only attorneys may address the court during oral arguments. Victims and/or witnesses may attend an oral argument which is open to the public. The defendant will not be present if he or she is in prison.After the Court of Appeals receives the briefs and has heard arguments, it may take several months or more to make a decision. Ultimately, the appellate court's final decision will either"

    "When you make a purchase and pay with your credit card, you don't actually pay money to the merchant. Rather, the merchant is paid by your credit card company. Once the transaction is approved by your card issuer, your available credit goes down. Even though the merchant has been paid, you aren't billed by the credit card company until later.You can't pay a credit card with a credit card directly, but you might be able to pay a credit card with cash from another card. Let's say you have two credit cards, Card A and Card B. You can't afford to make your minimum payment on Card A, so you're looking to Card B for a little help.If you use your debit card to overdraw your bank account on a regular basis or do so and leave the negative balance long-term, it could negatively impact your credit score. Banks do report checking and savings details like this to the credit bureaus. The Bottom Line on Debit Cards as Credit Cards.If the transfer is considered a cash advance transaction (and it usually will be), then you'll pay a fee worth around 3% of the total you send to your bank account. Cash advance interest rate. In most cases, your transfer will be charged interest at the cash advance rate.A refund for a returned item will not usually post to your credit card account instantly.Instead it generally takes several business days, and potentially even up to a week, before a refunded purchase will appear on your credit card ledger and affect your card balance. Generally, when a refund is processed for a returned item within the same credit card billing cycle, you won't be held responsible to make a payment on that specific charge.If you were to return a purchase near or after the end of your billing cycle, the refund for the transaction might not show on your account before your next credit card payment is due. Regardless of the timing of the purchase and the return, if you fail to make at least the minimum payment on your account prior to the due date then you could be penalized by your credit card company in the form of a late fee. You can't skip making a minimum payment if there is any amount due to the card issuer, even if you expect to get a refund."

Solar energy is an example of alternative energy. Thus, unlike conventional energies, alternative energy sources do not use fossil fuels.\n \n\n Alternative energy sources work in different ways, depending on the raw material being used, such as solar energy, which captures sunlight and transforms it into electrical energy, or biomass, which can be used as a substitute for oil.\n \n\n As they do not use fossil fuels, the capture of these types of energy can take place through more elaborate processes.",

    "The global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2019 was 409.8 parts per million (ppm for short), with a range of uncertainty of plus or minus 0.1 ppm. Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in at least the past 800,000 years.In fact, the last time the atmospheric CO‚öáá amounts were this high was more than 3 million years ago, when temperature was 2¨‚àû–3¨‚àûC (3.6¨‚àû–5.4¨‚àûF) higher than during the pre-industrial era, and sea level was 15–25 meters (50–80 feet) higher than today.Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. According to State of the Climate in 2019 from NOAA and the American Meteorological Society, Global atmospheric carbon dioxide was 409.8 ± 0.1 ppm in 2019, a new record high. That is an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm from 2018, the same as the increase between 2017 and 2018. In the 1960s, the global growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.6 ± 0.1 ppm per year. Between 2009-18, however, the growth rate has been 2.3 ppm per year. The annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Warmed by sunlight, Earth's land and ocean surfaces continuously radiate thermal infrared energy (heat). Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb that heat and release it gradually over time, like bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out. Without this natural greenhouse effect, Earth's average annual temperature would be below freezing instead of close to 60¨‚àûF. But increases in greenhouse gases have tipped the Earth's energy budget out of balance, trapping additional heat and raising Earth's average temperature."

    "The global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2019 was 409.8 parts per million (ppm for short), with a range of uncertainty of plus or minus 0.1 ppm. Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in at least the past 800,000 years.In fact, the last time the atmospheric CO‚öáá amounts were this high was more than 3 million years ago, when temperature was 2¨‚àû–3¨‚àûC (3.6¨‚àû–5.4¨‚àûF) higher than during the pre-industrial era, and sea level was 15–25 meters (50–80 feet) higher than today.Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. According to State of the Climate in 2019 from NOAA and the American Meteorological Society, Global atmospheric carbon dioxide was 409.8 ± 0.1 ppm in 2019, a new record high. That is an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm from 2018, the same as the increase between 2017 and 2018. In the 1960s, the global growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.6 ± 0.1 ppm per year. Between 2009-18, however, the growth rate has been 2.3 ppm per year. The annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Warmed by sunlight, Earth's land and ocean surfaces continuously radiate thermal infrared energy (heat). Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb that heat and release it gradually over time, like bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out. Without this natural greenhouse effect, Earth's average annual temperature would be below freezing instead of close to 60¨‚àûF. But increases in greenhouse gases have tipped the Earth's energy budget out of balance, trapping additional heat and raising Earth's average temperature."

    "The organizers of the tournament had imposed a rule requiring all matches to have a winner, and this was enforced with an unusual variant of the golden goal rule: the first goal scored in extra-time not only won the match, but was also worth two goals. Barbados started the match needing to win by a margin of at least two goals to qualify for the final tournament, and after Grenada scored late in normal time to bring the scoreline to 2–1, Barbados deliberately scored an own goal to force extra-time, where they could get the two-goal winning margin they needed courtesy of the unconventional golden goal rule.[1] This resulted in an unusual situation: for the last three minutes of the match, Grenada was trying to score in both goals, as either outcome (3–2 or 2–3) would have advanced them to the finals, while Barbados had to defend both goals. Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the match.The 1994 Caribbean Cup was the fifth edition of the Caribbean Cup and was played in Trinidad and Tobago. Qualification took place in various other locations around the Caribbean in early 1994.[3] At the time, FIFA had been testing variations on tournament rules,[4] and the tournament organizers had decided that any matches where the score was tied at the end of the normal 90 minutes would go to extra-time, which would feature a golden goal that, if scored, would be worth two goals.[1] Barbados, Grenada, and Puerto Rico were drawn into Group 1, and on January 23 the round-robin tournament kicked off in Barbados, with the home team falling 0–1 to Puerto Rico. Two days later, Grenada defeated Puerto Rico 2–0 after a golden goal in extra-time. This put Grenada at the top of the group with three points and a +2 goal difference.[3] Thus, the only way that Barbados could advance to the finals would be if they could beat Grenada by a margin of at least two goals."

Following graduation in 1983, Obama worked in New York City, then became a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago, coordinating with churches to improve housing conditions and set up job-training programs in a community hit hard by steel mill closures. In 1988, he went to Harvard Law School, where he attracted national attention as the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review. Returning to Chicago, he joined a small law firm specializing in civil rights.As an incoming president, Obama faced many challenges‚öÑÆan economic collapse, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the continuing menace of terrorism.

While the nuclear reactors and spent nuclear material are safe, and the Plant is not at danger of a meltdown or other nuclear accident, the Plant is struggling to maintain daily operation in the wake of flooding of its facility. While nuclear power is not as clean as energy from renewable resources like solar power or wind power, it doesn't create the same waste and pollution as fossil fuel energy. Nonetheless, the challenge to safely operate a power plant on nuclear fuel will always be questioned, as the consequences of errors and natural disasters can be very high.",

    "The fledgling WFL did succeed in raising stagnant salaries in the NFL. Average salaries in professional football were among the lowest in the four major North American sports, and the National Football League Players Association and the Canadian Football League Players Association had both gone on strike prior to their leagues' respective 1974 seasons in an effort to lift many of the rules suppressing free agency and player salaries. In addition, the NFL did not have a free agency system in place then (and one would not be established until 1993).With the uncertain labor situation, the WFL had the opportunity to provide players with a better deal than the established leagues would give them, along with the promise of employment. Davidson's league garnered major publicity when the Toronto Northmen, led by John F. Bassett, signed three Miami Dolphins players, fullback Larry Csonka,[1] halfback Jim Kiick, and wide receiver Paul Warfield[4] to what was then the richest three-player deal in sports, an astounding US$3.5 million to start in 1975. The pact was a guaranteed, personal-services contract, so the trio would be paid even if the WFL did not survive its first season.\n The NFL took notice, as did their players when they were approached to jump leagues. The Oakland Raiders nearly lost both their quarterbacks. Ken Stabler[1] signed with the Birmingham Americans, and Daryle Lamonica penned a contract to play for the Southern California Sun starting in 1975. John Wilbur left the Over-the-Hill Gang as a Washington Redskin to invest, coach special teams, and play for the Hawaiians. The Dallas Cowboys also took roster hits when WFL teams in Hawaii and Houston signed running back Calvin Hill and quarterback Craig Morton respectively. The Hawaiians also signed Minnesota Vikings Pro Bowl WR John Gilliam and San Francisco 49ers All-Pro TE Ted Kwalick: however, Gilliam ended up with the Chicago Winds and Kwalick signed with the Philadelphia Bell prior to the 1975 season.By early June 1974, the WFL claimed they had some 60 NFL players under contract. Many of these defections came in the form of futures contracts. The players would play out their existing deals with the NFL, then jump to the WFL when those deals expired. Thus, Stabler would stay with the Raiders through 1975, then would have joined Birmingham in 1976 had the team and league survived that long."

    "Addison's disease is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system erroneously attacks the adrenal glands degrading the external layer. The condition occurs in only about 1-person per 100,000 but happens at all age levels in men and women. Addison's disease develops when the adrenal glands produce too little cortisol and inadequate levels of aldosterone, severely impacting your health. The adverse condition is often confused with adrenal insufficiency and if left untreated, can be life-threatening. The adrenal glands are positioned just above the kidneys. When these organs are damaged, it affects your endocrine system, disrupting hormone production. Hormones are vital and used to signal instructions to every tissue and organ in the body. The interior of your adrenal glands, known as the medulla, generate adrenaline hormones while the outer layer, known as the cortex, produces corticosteroids. Certain corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids are essential for life. Treatment for Addison's disease requires hormone replacement therapy to balance the body's levels of adrenaline and return to a healthy baseline level. Here are 12 signs of Addison's disease, if you display any of the symptoms, consult with a medical professional."

    "Empathy, the ability to imagine another's perspective as if it were our own, was found to be hardwired into the human brain to such a degree that the mind behaves the same under MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans when it regards oneself as it does when it regards close friends. To test empathetic behavior, scientists examined MRI scans of people's brains made to feel threatened by an oncoming electrical shock to either themselves, a close friend, or a stranger. Scientists found that the brain regions that correspond to threat responses were essentially activated equally under the threat to oneself or a close friend, but not to a stranger, which led them to believe that the human brain identify oneself with close others, virtually seeing oneself as the same as one's close friends."

When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport."

    "Because the 1897 flood is often used as a measure of other Red River Valley floods, a description of it at Fargo and Grand Forks was included in a 1952 U.S. Geological Survey Water Supply Paper. Text from that description is reprinted below.The present indications are that we will have high water this spring, as high if not higher, than it was in the spring of 1861. If all reports are true there is more snow on the level now than there was in the spring of 1861. That year the entire valley was flooded from Big Stone Lake to Winnipeg, a distance of more than 300 miles. There are but four men living in the valley now that witnessed the great flood of '61 -- the largest body of fresh water in the world at that time * * * R. M. Probesfield is authority for saying that he, a few days ago, measured the snow in his timber, where it was free from drifting and it measured 5 feet. This measurement is two and one-half feet more snow than we had in 1861. Those facts prove that we will have a greater flood this year than in the history of the valley. Old Settler.The flood forecast by \"Old Settler\" was not long delayed. The Red crested at Wahpeton on March 31, 2' 8\" above the 1893 high. By April 1, 1897, the C. M. St. P. & P. Railway tracks between Fargo and Wahpeton were covered with water in spots and traffic was suspended. By April 2 the Buffalo River overflowed so a large lake was formed between Glyndon and Moorhead. The Wild Rice (N. Dak.) River was described as 'on a splurge too'. The Sheyenne River was reported rising slowly at Valley City on April 3. The Red crested early on the morning of April 7 at Fargo at 34.2 foot stage (present [1952] datum) exceeding the known high levels of 1871, 1873, and 1882. The Sheyenne River, by April 8, was up so high that water flowed overland from it to the Wild Rice River. The flood of 1897 at Fargo covered most of the business and residential areas of the city."

Barbados started the match needing to win by a margin of at least two goals to qualify for the final tournament, and after Grenada scored late in normal time to bring the scoreline to 2–1, Barbados deliberately scored an own goal to force extra-time, where they could get the two-goal winning margin they needed courtesy of the unconventional golden goal rule.[1] This resulted in an unusual situation: for the last three minutes of the match, Grenada was trying to score in both goals, as either outcome (3–2 or 2–3) would have advanced them to the finals, while Barbados had to defend both goals. Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the match.The 1994 Caribbean Cup was the fifth edition of the Caribbean Cup and was played in Trinidad and Tobago. Qualification took place in various other locations around the Caribbean in early 1994.[3] At the time, FIFA had been testing variations on tournament rules,[4] and the tournament organizers had decided that any matches where the score was tied at the end of the normal 90 minutes would go to extra-time, which would feature a golden goal that, if scored, would be worth two goals.[1] Barbados, Grenada, and Puerto Rico were drawn into Group 1, and on January 23 the round-robin tournament kicked off in Barbados, with the home team falling 0–1 to Puerto Rico. Two days later, Grenada defeated Puerto Rico 2–0 after a golden goal in extra-time. This put Grenada at the top of the group with three points and a +2 goal difference.[3] Thus, the only way that Barbados could advance to the finals would be if they could beat Grenada by a margin of at least two goals."

    "A fingerprint is an impression left by the friction ridges of a human finger. The recovery of partial fingerprints from a crime scene is an important method of forensic science. Moisture and grease on a finger result in fingerprints on surfaces such as glass or metal. Deliberate impressions of entire fingerprints can be obtained by ink or other substances transferred from the peaks of friction ridges on the skin to a smooth surface such as paper. Fingerprint records normally contain impressions from the pad on the last joint of fingers and thumbs, though fingerprint cards also typically record portions of lower joint areas of the fingers."

    "he year 2020 has been one of the toughest years for humanity. It saw global challenges to our ways of life, our governments, and our economies. But 2021 has begun with a ray of hope: The beginning of vaccination drive around the world against COVID-19 is expected to gradually bring life back to some semblance of normalcy, and strengthen economic activity in a backdrop of supportive policy stance by most nations. The optimism is reflected in the projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). After a contraction of 3.5% in 2020, IMF expects the global economy to grow 5.5% in 2021 and 4.2% in 2022. The impact of COVID-19 has been severe across nations; however, nations are gradually working to recover.With a growth expectation of 11.5% in 2021, India is projected to be the fastest-growing trillion-dollar economy in the world. The decision to impose a complete lockdown in the first half of 2020 to combat the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a near-halt of its economic activities. Its negative impact was evident in two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, as a result of which India entered into a technical recession for the first time in its history. Overall, the country witnessed a contraction of 8% during 2020 according to the IMF. However, this is a temporary phase, and India is still a compelling growth story.The Union Budget presented on February 1, 2021 brought cheer to the markets and promises to focus on growth. Commending the Government of India on its Union Budget 2021-22, USISPF President and CEO Mukesh Aghi said, \"The Union Budget 2021-22 has taken into consideration the needs of all sectors of the economy, reflecting a robust growth plan for India to become a $5 trillion economy. Increased government spending in critical areas of the economy, such as agriculture, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and defense, has been much needed.\""

Protestant descendants of those excluded for being Roman Catholics are eligible.[2]\n \n\n Queen Elizabeth II is the sovereign, and her heir apparent is her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales. Next in line after him is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales's elder son. Third in line is Prince George, the eldest child of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, Princess Charlotte, and his younger brother, Prince Louis. Sixth in line is Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, the younger son of the Prince of Wales. Under the Perth Agreement, which came into effect in 2015, only the first six in line of succession require the sovereign's consent before they marry; without such consent, they and their children would be disqualified from succession.\n \n\n The first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21, and the sovereign's consort, may be appointed counsellors of state. Counsellors of state perform some of the sovereign's duties in the United Kingdom while he or she is out of the country or temporarily incapacitated. Otherwise, individuals in the line of succession need not have specific legal or official roles."

    "The global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2019 was 409.8 parts per million (ppm for short), with a range of uncertainty of plus or minus 0.1 ppm. Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in at least the past 800,000 years.In fact, the last time the atmospheric CO‚öáá amounts were this high was more than 3 million years ago, when temperature was 2¨‚àû–3¨‚àûC (3.6¨‚àû–5.4¨‚àûF) higher than during the pre-industrial era, and sea level was 15–25 meters (50–80 feet) higher than today.Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. According to State of the Climate in 2019 from NOAA and the American Meteorological Society, Global atmospheric carbon dioxide was 409.8 ± 0.1 ppm in 2019, a new record high. That is an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm from 2018, the same as the increase between 2017 and 2018. In the 1960s, the global growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.6 ± 0.1 ppm per year. Between 2009-18, however, the growth rate has been 2.3 ppm per year. The annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Warmed by sunlight, Earth's land and ocean surfaces continuously radiate thermal infrared energy (heat). Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb that heat and release it gradually over time, like bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out. Without this natural greenhouse effect, Earth's average annual temperature would be below freezing instead of close to 60¨‚àûF. But increases in greenhouse gases have tipped the Earth's energy budget out of balance, trapping additional heat and raising Earth's average temperature."
