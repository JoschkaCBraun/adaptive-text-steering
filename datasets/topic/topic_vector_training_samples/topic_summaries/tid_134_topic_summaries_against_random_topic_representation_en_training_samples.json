Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

    "Pilot Ian Jennings was sentenced to nine months in prison for flying an airliner when he was over three and a half times the alcohol limit. A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

The UK is one of only four European countries to have increased pollution from energy production, with only Malta getting worse. The other 23 EU nations have managed to cut emissions from energy companies. Carbon dioxide is responsible for more than 80 percent of Britain's total greenhouse gas emissions. With 40 percent of emissions coming from the energy sector and just 15 percent coming from homes, critics say focusing on households while increasing output from power plants is futile. In 2011, Britain made the biggest emission cuts in the EU, reducing total greenhouse gas production by 40 million tonnes, down 7 percent. Earlier this week, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said he will push the EU to adopt the toughest green targets in the world. He said he would pursue a legally binding target to cut collective greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 50% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels."

Barbados started the match needing to win by a margin of at least two goals to qualify for the final tournament, and after Grenada scored late in normal time to bring the scoreline to 2–1, Barbados deliberately scored an own goal to force extra-time, where they could get the two-goal winning margin they needed courtesy of the unconventional golden goal rule.[1] This resulted in an unusual situation: for the last three minutes of the match, Grenada was trying to score in both goals, as either outcome (3–2 or 2–3) would have advanced them to the finals, while Barbados had to defend both goals. Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the match.The 1994 Caribbean Cup was the fifth edition of the Caribbean Cup and was played in Trinidad and Tobago. Qualification took place in various other locations around the Caribbean in early 1994.[3] At the time, FIFA had been testing variations on tournament rules,[4] and the tournament organizers had decided that any matches where the score was tied at the end of the normal 90 minutes would go to extra-time, which would feature a golden goal that, if scored, would be worth two goals.[1] Barbados, Grenada, and Puerto Rico were drawn into Group 1, and on January 23 the round-robin tournament kicked off in Barbados, with the home team falling 0–1 to Puerto Rico. Two days later, Grenada defeated Puerto Rico 2–0 after a golden goal in extra-time. This put Grenada at the top of the group with three points and a +2 goal difference.[3] Thus, the only way that Barbados could advance to the finals would be if they could beat Grenada by a margin of at least two goals."

Aircraft engines emit a number of other gases and particles that can be harmful.",

    "Since the repeal of the 55 mph national maximum speed limit on US interstatehighways, speed limits have been raised across the country to as high as 75 mph and more.While many studies have addressed the effects of increased speeds on accident frequencyand severity, the factors that determine drivers' choice of speed in the presence of speedlimits are still not well understood. This paper provides additional insight into drivers'choice of speed by using a survey of Indiana drivers. The survey is timely since Indianarecently raised speed limits on rural interstates to 70 mph. With urban and suburban areasincluded, interstate speed limits in the state are now 55 mph, 65 mph and 70 mph. Usingseemingly unrelated regression estimation, models of normal interstate driving speeds with low-traffic conditions are estimated for 55 mph, 65 mph and 70 mph speed limits."

Although these highways and interstates may have some segments with designated speeds, they generally have posted speed limits as follows:American law follows the basic idea that most people are reasonable and laws exist to control the few who are unreasonable or inconsiderate. The posted speed zones follow the same idea.Studies performed in Oregon and throughout the United States serve as the basis for how we establish speed zones.

    "When Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, he became the first African American to hold the office. The framers of the Constitution always hoped that our leadership would not be limited to Americans of wealth or family connections. Subject to the prejudices of their time‚öÑÆmany of them owned slaves‚öÑÆmost would not have foreseen an African American president. Obama's father, Barack Sr., a Kenyan economist, met his mother, Stanley Ann Dunham, when both were students in Hawaii, where Barack was born on August 4, 1961. They later divorced, and Barack's mother married a man from Indonesia, where he spent his early childhood. Before fifth grade, he returned to Honolulu to live with his maternal grandparents and attend Punahou School on scholarship.In his memoir Dreams from My Father (1995), Obama describes the complexities of discovering his identity in adolescence. After two years at Occidental College in Los Angeles, he transferred to Columbia University, where he studied political science and international relations. Following graduation in 1983, Obama worked in New York City, then became a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago, coordinating with churches to improve housing conditions and set up job-training programs in a community hit hard by steel mill closures. In 1988, he went to Harvard Law School, where he attracted national attention as the first African American president of the Harvard Law Review. Returning to Chicago, he joined a small law firm specializing in civil rights.As an incoming president, Obama faced many challenges‚öÑÆan economic collapse, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the continuing menace of terrorism. Inaugurated before an estimated crowd of 1.8 million people, Obama proposed unprecedented federal spending to revive the economy and also hoped to renew America's stature in the world. During his first term he signed three signature bills: an omnibus bill to stimulate the economy, legislation making health care more accessible and affordable, and legislation reforming the nation's financial institutions. Obama also pressed for a fair pay act for women, financial reform legislation, and efforts for consumer protection. In 2009, Obama became the fourth president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize."

    "Pilot Ian Jennings was sentenced to nine months in prison for flying an airliner when he was over three and a half times the alcohol limit. A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

    "The organizers of the tournament had imposed a rule requiring all matches to have a winner, and this was enforced with an unusual variant of the golden goal rule: the first goal scored in extra-time not only won the match, but was also worth two goals. Barbados started the match needing to win by a margin of at least two goals to qualify for the final tournament, and after Grenada scored late in normal time to bring the scoreline to 2–1, Barbados deliberately scored an own goal to force extra-time, where they could get the two-goal winning margin they needed courtesy of the unconventional golden goal rule.[1] This resulted in an unusual situation: for the last three minutes of the match, Grenada was trying to score in both goals, as either outcome (3–2 or 2–3) would have advanced them to the finals, while Barbados had to defend both goals. Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the match.The 1994 Caribbean Cup was the fifth edition of the Caribbean Cup and was played in Trinidad and Tobago. Qualification took place in various other locations around the Caribbean in early 1994.[3] At the time, FIFA had been testing variations on tournament rules,[4] and the tournament organizers had decided that any matches where the score was tied at the end of the normal 90 minutes would go to extra-time, which would feature a golden goal that, if scored, would be worth two goals.[1] Barbados, Grenada, and Puerto Rico were drawn into Group 1, and on January 23 the round-robin tournament kicked off in Barbados, with the home team falling 0–1 to Puerto Rico. Two days later, Grenada defeated Puerto Rico 2–0 after a golden goal in extra-time. This put Grenada at the top of the group with three points and a +2 goal difference.[3] Thus, the only way that Barbados could advance to the finals would be if they could beat Grenada by a margin of at least two goals."

    "Pilot Ian Jennings was sentenced to nine months in prison for flying an airliner when he was over three and a half times the alcohol limit. A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

The Putin government showed low regard for the rule of law and human rights in suppressing insurgency in the North Caucasus, according to critics. Dmitry Medvedev, Putin's longtime prot‚àög‚àö, was elected president in 2008; President Medvedev immediately designated Putin as prime minister and continued Putin's policies. In August 2008, the Medvedev-Putin \"tandem\" directed military operations against Georgia and recognized the independence of Georgia's separatist South Ossetia and Abkhazia, actions condemned by most of the international community. In March 2012, Putin was (re)elected president by a wide margin. The day after Putin's inauguration in May 2012, the legislature confirmed Medvedev as prime minister. Since then, Putin has tightened restrictions on freedom of assembly and other human rights.

    "Pilot Ian Jennings was sentenced to nine months in prison for flying an airliner when he was over three and a half times the alcohol limit. A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the match.The 1994 Caribbean Cup was the fifth edition of the Caribbean Cup and was played in Trinidad and Tobago. Qualification took place in various other locations around the Caribbean in early 1994.[3] At the time, FIFA had been testing variations on tournament rules,[4] and the tournament organizers had decided that any matches where the score was tied at the end of the normal 90 minutes would go to extra-time, which would feature a golden goal that, if scored, would be worth two goals.[1] Barbados, Grenada, and Puerto Rico were drawn into Group 1, and on January 23 the round-robin tournament kicked off in Barbados, with the home team falling 0–1 to Puerto Rico. Two days later, Grenada defeated Puerto Rico 2–0 after a golden goal in extra-time. This put Grenada at the top of the group with three points and a +2 goal difference.[3] Thus, the only way that Barbados could advance to the finals would be if they could beat Grenada by a margin of at least two goals."

    "Parents from immigrant families from Eastern European nations have expressed that British schools fail to academically challenge their children, additionally regarding the NHS as problematic, for their health treatments are so agonizingly slow that some parents fly their children to their home countries to obtain treatment. These sentiments are sourced from interviews with 57 families from the European Union, and these formerly communist countries were found to provide superior public services relative to their British counterparts. Fearing that teachers underestimate the migrant children's academic competency due to the their struggles in English, many children feel as if they cannot reach their academic goals. These Eastern European families perceive that British services are either too expensive, different, or worse relative to their home country, which often spurs them to travel home to slash the cost and waiting time they would encounter when dealing with the NHS."

These bans started in 1921 and were only lifted in 1971. As sports writer Jim Weeks notes, ‚öÑ∫by this time, half a century of progress had been lost‚öÑπ.

    "The Criminal Justice system can be a complicated system to follow. For a crime victim and/or witness who is also coping with the crime and its effects, the entire process can be difficult and stressful.Further complicating matters is the fact that, once there is a conviction and the case is thought to be finished, the defendant ordinarily has the right to appeal.An appeal from a judgment in a federal criminal case is a request by the losing party to have the federal Court of Appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court review the decisions made in the district court. Many of the issues raised on appeal concern how the district court judge managed a trial or plea, or ruled at sentencing. In most criminal cases, an appeal is brought by a defendant after a court or jury finds him or her guilty.Appeals by the government are limited by the United States Constitution. The 5th Amendment's ‚öÑ∫double jeopardy‚öÑπ clause protects against multiple prosecutions for the same offense. Therefore, if the defendant is acquitted, the government cannot appeal.\n There are limited instances, however, when the government can appeal. The government may appeal court rulings which grant a defendant post-conviction relief (e.g., the reversal of a conviction). It may also appeal district court decisions on certain pre-trial motions (e.g., the suppression of evidence and sentencing issues).Appeals arising out of cases from the Federal district courts of Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana are handled by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, located in Chicago, Illinois. Criminal appellate procedure involves a set of rules and time limits which guide a case through the appellate process. This process begins when a defendant convicted at the district court level files a ‚öÑ∫Notice of Appeal.‚öÑπ The defendant's notice of appeal must usually be filed within ten days following the district court's entry of judgment. If the government is appealing the district court's decision, a timely notice of appeal may be filed within thirty days following entry of judgment.The defendant, now referred to as the ‚öÑ∫appellant,‚öÑπ must file an ‚öÑ∫appellant's brief.‚öÑπ A brief is a written legal argument which conveys the case to the court. On the average, it takes several months for a case to move from sentencing to the filing of the appellant's brief.The government then responds to the appellant's brief by filing an ‚öÑ∫appellee's‚öÑπ brief approximately thirty days thereafter. The appellee's brief is an answer to the challenge made by the defendant. The defendant may, within fourteen days thereafter, file an ‚öÑ∫appellant's reply brief‚öÑπ before the Court of Appeals considers the case.In most cases, following briefing, oral arguments are scheduled before a panel of three judges. An oral argument is an opportunity for each party's attorney to persuade the court and answer any questions from the judges. The argument, regarding the issues raised, usually lasts a total of 20 to 30 minutes. Only attorneys may address the court during oral arguments. Victims and/or witnesses may attend an oral argument which is open to the public. The defendant will not be present if he or she is in prison.After the Court of Appeals receives the briefs and has heard arguments, it may take several months or more to make a decision. Ultimately, the appellate court's final decision will either"

Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

The Education Secretary Michael Gove wants to help out the community and open a free school program but Greg Pope, deputy director of the Catholic Education Service argued that there will be a problem for the church to launch a free school program. The problem is that a free school program would more than likely go against the Catholic Churches rules since free schools are ran by teachers, charities, faith groups, and many other organizations.

But the German league outperforms its rivals with combined profits of $242 million, compared with the Premier League's $154 million. The Premier League's continued growth is also moderated by debt.

    "Pilot Ian Jennings was sentenced to nine months in prison for flying an airliner when he was over three and a half times the alcohol limit. A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

    "Addison's disease is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system erroneously attacks the adrenal glands degrading the external layer. The condition occurs in only about 1-person per 100,000 but happens at all age levels in men and women. Addison's disease develops when the adrenal glands produce too little cortisol and inadequate levels of aldosterone, severely impacting your health. The adverse condition is often confused with adrenal insufficiency and if left untreated, can be life-threatening. The adrenal glands are positioned just above the kidneys. When these organs are damaged, it affects your endocrine system, disrupting hormone production. Hormones are vital and used to signal instructions to every tissue and organ in the body. The interior of your adrenal glands, known as the medulla, generate adrenaline hormones while the outer layer, known as the cortex, produces corticosteroids. Certain corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids are essential for life. Treatment for Addison's disease requires hormone replacement therapy to balance the body's levels of adrenaline and return to a healthy baseline level. Here are 12 signs of Addison's disease, if you display any of the symptoms, consult with a medical professional."

Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

    "Pilot Ian Jennings was sentenced to nine months in prison for flying an airliner when he was over three and a half times the alcohol limit. A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

Due to an unusual scoring rule and the two teams' respective positions in the tournament, it became alternately in the best interest of each team to score an own goal. The result has been described as \"one of the strangest football matches ever\"The organizers of the tournament had imposed a rule requiring all matches to have a winner, and this was enforced with an unusual variant of the golden goal rule: the first goal scored in extra-time not only won the match, but was also worth two goals. Barbados started the match needing to win by a margin of at least two goals to qualify for the final tournament, and after Grenada scored late in normal time to bring the scoreline to 2–1, Barbados deliberately scored an own goal to force extra-time, where they could get the two-goal winning margin they needed courtesy of the unconventional golden goal rule.[1] This resulted in an unusual situation: for the last three minutes of the match, Grenada was trying to score in both goals, as either outcome (3–2 or 2–3) would have advanced them to the finals, while Barbados had to defend both goals. Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the matchThe outcome of the match was criticized by Grenadian manager James Clarkson, who felt that his team had been cheated out of advancing to the finals. However, FIFA chose to not punish Barbados given the unusual tournament rules."

Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

The Red crested at Wahpeton on March 31, 2' 8\" above the 1893 high. By April 1, 1897, the C. M. St. P. & P. Railway tracks between Fargo and Wahpeton were covered with water in spots and traffic was suspended. By April 2 the Buffalo River overflowed so a large lake was formed between Glyndon and Moorhead. The Wild Rice (N. Dak.) River was described as 'on a splurge too'. The Sheyenne River was reported rising slowly at Valley City on April 3. The Red crested early on the morning of April 7 at Fargo at 34.2 foot stage (present [1952] datum) exceeding the known high levels of 1871, 1873, and 1882. The Sheyenne River, by April 8, was up so high that water flowed overland from it to the Wild Rice River. The flood of 1897 at Fargo covered most of the business and residential areas of the city.The present indications are that we will have high water this spring, as high if not higher, than it was in the spring of 1861. If all reports are true there is more snow on the level now than there was in the spring of 1861. That year the entire valley was flooded from Big Stone Lake to Winnipeg, a distance of more than 300 miles. There are but four men living in the valley now that witnessed the great flood of '61 -- the largest body of fresh water in the world at that time * * * R. M. Probesfield is authority for saying that he, a few days ago, measured the snow in his timber, where it was free from drifting and it measured 5 feet. This measurement is two and one-half feet more snow than we had in 1861. Those facts prove that we will have a greater flood this year than in the history of the valley. Old Settler."

    "Pilot Ian Jennings was sentenced to nine months in prison for flying an airliner when he was over three and a half times the alcohol limit. A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\".

A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot.

    "Pilot Ian Jennings was sentenced to nine months in prison for flying an airliner when he was over three and a half times the alcohol limit. A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

Next in line after him is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales's elder son. Third in line is Prince George, the eldest child of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, Princess Charlotte, and his younger brother, Prince Louis. Sixth in line is Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, the younger son of the Prince of Wales. Under the Perth Agreement, which came into effect in 2015, only the first six in line of succession require the sovereign's consent before they marry; without such consent, they and their children would be disqualified from succession.\n \n\n The first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21, and the sovereign's consort, may be appointed counsellors of state.

    "Pilot Ian Jennings was sentenced to nine months in prison for flying an airliner when he was over three and a half times the alcohol limit. A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

But in reality, their pay and benefits is only a tiny fraction of the military's budget, so it is likely that weapons will take the hit of the budget cuts rather than soldier pay. They are saying it will be soldier pay to pull on people's heartstrings and prevent the cuts from happening at all because they will feel bad for military families, but it's up to the military where the cuts apply to, and they could easily just not do as many weapons-building contracts."

    "Pilot Ian Jennings was sentenced to nine months in prison for flying an airliner when he was over three and a half times the alcohol limit. A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

However, societies around the world demonstrate tremendous variation in cultural understandings of family and marriage. Ideas about how people are related to each other, what kind of marriage would be ideal, when people should have children, who should care for children, and many other family related matters differ cross-culturally. While the function of families is to fulfill basic human needs such as providing for children, defining parental roles, regulating sexuality, and passing property and knowledge between generations, there are many variations or patterns of family life that can meet these needs. This chapter introduces some of the more common patterns of family life found around the world. It is important to remember that within any cultural framework variation does occur. Some variations on the standard pattern fall within what would be culturally considered the ‚öÑ∫range of acceptable alternatives.‚öÑπ Other family forms are not entirely accepted, but would still be recognized by most members of the community as reasonable."

Scientists have found that planes can be more environmentally friendly by avoiding the places where the thinly shaped clouds, called contrails, are produced - even if that means flying further and emitting more carbon dioxide. Previous research by scientists has shown that 7 per cent of the total distance flown by aircraft is in areas where the air is very cold and moist. Aircraft engines emit a number of other gases and particles that can be harmful.",

But the rebound is expected to be uneven across countries, as major economies look set to register strong growth even as many developing economies lag....Global growth is expected to accelerate to 5.6% this year, largely on the strength in major economies such as the United States and China. And while growth for almost every region of the world has been revised upward for 2021, many continue to grapple with COVID-19 and what is likely to be its long shadow. Despite this year's pickup, the level of global GDP in 2021 is expected to be 3.2% below pre-pandemic projections, and per capita GDP among many emerging market and developing economies is anticipated to remain below pre-COVID-19 peaks for an extended period. As the pandemic continues to flare, it will shape the path of global economic activity...The United States and China are each expected to contribute about one quarter of global growth in 2021. The U.S. economy has been bolstered by massive fiscal support, vaccination is expected to become widespread by mid-2021, and growth is expected to reach 6.8% this year, the fastest pace since 1984.

    "A popular misconception is that fingerprints can be lifted from practically any surface and they can easily solve a crime. In reality, fingerprints can be useful in solving a crime, but only if there is sufficient detail on the prints or partial prints left behind for classification purposes, and then only if the prints belong to someone who has already been previously arrested and fingerprinted to make a comparison match. Otherwise, they are of no immediate value. How about confessions of the accused? Confessions are, indeed, of great value when they can be legally obtained. However, they must be freely and voluntarily given, and then only after the accused has been advised of his constitutional rights per the Miranda ruling. The accused is not required to make, and cannot be compelled to make, confessions or admissions of any kind, nor can they be questioned without a lawyer present if they ask for one. An arrest occurs when a person, usually a law enforcement officer, uses legal authority to restrict a suspect's freedom of movement. Probable cause is the key issue in the arrest process. The police need probable cause to make an arrest or obtain an arrest warrant from a judge.Generally, probable cause requires more than mere suspicion that a suspect committed a crime but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Probable cause is a reasonable belief in the suspect's guilt, based on the facts and information prior to the arrest."

    "Pilot Ian Jennings was sentenced to nine months in prison for flying an airliner when he was over three and a half times the alcohol limit. A pilot who flew a business jet from Spain while having a hangover from binge drinking for three days has been jailed. Ian Jennings, 47, of Gosport, Hampshire, was arrested at Norwich Airport after landing on a commercial chartered plane carrying millionaire junkyard tycoon Andre Serruys with a wife and three teenage girls. A passenger on the flight became suspicious and alerted police that the pilot may have been drinking, Norwich Crown Court has learned. When officers tested Jennings' breath on October 30, he \"smelled strongly of alcohol and appeared nervous.\" It turned out to be three times the legal limit for a pilot. Jennings, who admitted to stealing when the alcohol on his breath was over the prescribed limit in a previous hearing, claimed he had only drunk three pints of lager the night before, but Judge Stephen Holt told him that statement \"didn't match\". Her attorney admitted that Jennings may have broken down to \"refuel\" after several days of heavy drinking to celebrate her engagement. Prosecutor Chris Youell said Jennings showed up for work at 8 a.m. that morning and there was no evidence he had consumed alcohol that day. He was not subjected to the breathalyzer test until after 2 p.m. Sentencing him to nine months in prison, Judge Holt said: ‚öÑ∫About eight or nine hours earlier you must have been considerably higher than the level detected. - You must have drunk a lot the day before you left for the airport.",

    "Measles was eliminated in the United States in 2000. High national coverage with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and rapid implementation of measles control measures prevent widespread measles transmission.During January–September 2019, 1,249 U.S. measles cases were reported, the highest annual number since 1992. Eighty-nine percent of measles patients were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status, and 10% were hospitalized. Eighty-six percent of cases were associated with outbreaks in underimmunized, close-knit communities, including two outbreaks in New York Orthodox Jewish communities that threatened measles elimination status in the United States.During January 1–October 1, 2019, a total of 1,249 measles cases and 22 measles outbreaks were reported in the United States. This represents the most U.S. cases reported in a single year since 1992 (1), and the second highest number of reported outbreaks annually since measles was declared eliminated* in the United States in 2000 (2). Measles is an acute febrile rash illness with an attack rate of approximately 90% in susceptible household contacts (3). Domestic outbreaks can occur when travelers contract measles outside the United States and subsequently transmit infection to unvaccinated persons they expose in the United States. Among the 1,249 measles cases reported in 2019, 1,163 (93%) were associated with the 22 outbreaks, 1,107 (89%) were in patients who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status, and 119 (10%) measles patients were hospitalized. Closely related outbreaks in New York City (NYC) and New York State (NYS; excluding NYC), with ongoing transmission for nearly 1 year in large and close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities, accounted for 934 (75%) cases during 2019 and threatened the elimination status of measles in the United States. Robust responses in NYC and NYS were effective in controlling transmission before the 1-year mark; however, continued vigilance for additional cases within these communities is essential to determine whether elimination has been sustained. Collaboration between public health authorities and undervaccinated communities is important for preventing outbreaks and limiting transmission. The combination of maintenance of high national vaccination coverage with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) and rapid implementation of measles control measures remains the cornerstone for preventing widespread measles transmission (4)."
