With 40 percent of emissions coming from the energy sector and just 15 percent coming from homes, critics say focusing on households while increasing output from power plants is futile. In 2011, Britain made the biggest emission cuts in the EU, reducing total greenhouse gas production by 40 million tonnes, down 7 percent.

Barbados started the match needing to win by a margin of at least two goals to qualify for the final tournament, and after Grenada scored late in normal time to bring the scoreline to 2–1, Barbados deliberately scored an own goal to force extra-time, where they could get the two-goal winning margin they needed courtesy of the unconventional golden goal rule.[1] This resulted in an unusual situation: for the last three minutes of the match, Grenada was trying to score in both goals, as either outcome (3–2 or 2–3) would have advanced them to the finals, while Barbados had to defend both goals. Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the match.The 1994 Caribbean Cup was the fifth edition of the Caribbean Cup and was played in Trinidad and Tobago. Qualification took place in various other locations around the Caribbean in early 1994.[3] At the time, FIFA had been testing variations on tournament rules,[4] and the tournament organizers had decided that any matches where the score was tied at the end of the normal 90 minutes would go to extra-time, which would feature a golden goal that, if scored, would be worth two goals.[1] Barbados, Grenada, and Puerto Rico were drawn into Group 1, and on January 23 the round-robin tournament kicked off in Barbados, with the home team falling 0–1 to Puerto Rico. Two days later, Grenada defeated Puerto Rico 2–0 after a golden goal in extra-time. This put Grenada at the top of the group with three points and a +2 goal difference.[3] Thus, the only way that Barbados could advance to the finals would be if they could beat Grenada by a margin of at least two goals."

    "ccession to the British throne is determined by descent, sex (males born before 28 October 2011 precede their elder sisters in the line of succession), legitimacy, and religion. Under common law, the Crown is inherited by a sovereign's children or by a childless sovereign's nearest collateral line. The Bill of Rights 1689 and the Act of Settlement 1701 restrict succession to the throne to the legitimate Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover who are in \"communion with the Church of England\".[1] Spouses of Roman Catholics were disqualified from 1689 until the law was amended in 2015. Protestant descendants of those excluded for being Roman Catholics are eligible.[2]\n \n\n Queen Elizabeth II is the sovereign, and her heir apparent is her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales. Next in line after him is Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales's elder son. Third in line is Prince George, the eldest child of the Duke of Cambridge, followed by his sister, Princess Charlotte, and his younger brother, Prince Louis. Sixth in line is Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, the younger son of the Prince of Wales. Under the Perth Agreement, which came into effect in 2015, only the first six in line of succession require the sovereign's consent before they marry; without such consent, they and their children would be disqualified from succession.\n \n\n The first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21, and the sovereign's consort, may be appointed counsellors of state. Counsellors of state perform some of the sovereign's duties in the United Kingdom while he or she is out of the country or temporarily incapacitated.

    "Britain's power plants are still releasing large amounts of greenhouse gases, while households face a tax hike aimed at reducing emissions. Escalating pollution levels occur when the average family is forced to contribute £112 in green taxes each year. The UK is one of only four European countries to have increased pollution from energy production, with only Malta getting worse. The other 23 EU nations have managed to cut emissions from energy companies. Carbon dioxide is responsible for more than 80 percent of Britain's total greenhouse gas emissions. With 40 percent of emissions coming from the energy sector and just 15 percent coming from homes, critics say focusing on households while increasing output from power plants is futile. In 2011, Britain made the biggest emission cuts in the EU, reducing total greenhouse gas production by 40 million tonnes, down 7 percent. Earlier this week, Energy Secretary Ed Davey said he will push the EU to adopt the toughest green targets in the world. He said he would pursue a legally binding target to cut collective greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 50% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels."

Railway tracks between Fargo and Wahpeton were covered with water in spots and traffic was suspended. By April 2 the Buffalo River overflowed so a large lake was formed between Glyndon and Moorhead. The Wild Rice (N. Dak.) River was described as 'on a splurge too'. The Sheyenne River was reported rising slowly at Valley City on April 3. The Red crested early on the morning of April 7 at Fargo at 34.2 foot stage (present [1952] datum) exceeding the known high levels of 1871, 1873, and 1882. The Sheyenne River, by April 8, was up so high that water flowed overland from it to the Wild Rice River. The flood of 1897 at Fargo covered most of the business and residential areas of the city.The present indications are that we will have high water this spring, as high if not higher, than it was in the spring of 1861. If all reports are true there is more snow on the level now than there was in the spring of 1861. That year the entire valley was flooded from Big Stone Lake to Winnipeg, a distance of more than 300 miles. There are but four men living in the valley now that witnessed the great flood of '61 -- the largest body of fresh water in the world at that time * * * R. M. Probesfield is authority for saying that he, a few days ago, measured the snow in his timber, where it was free from drifting and it measured 5 feet. This measurement is two and one-half feet more snow than we had in 1861. Those facts prove that we will have a greater flood this year than in the history of the valley. Old Settler."

The Bundesliga's growing swings reflect the division's recent dominance on the field. Runner-up in 2012, Bayern Munich were crowned kings of Europe in May after beating Borussia Dortmund in the first all-German Champions League final. In the last 5-6 years in England, there has been an extra $3 billion injected into clubs, which can be used to finance a higher level of salary costs. The Premier League's continued growth is also moderated by debt."

    "Empathy, the ability to imagine another's perspective as if it were our own, was found to be hardwired into the human brain to such a degree that the mind behaves the same under MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scans when it regards oneself as it does when it regards close friends. To test empathetic behavior, scientists examined MRI scans of people's brains made to feel threatened by an oncoming electrical shock to either themselves, a close friend, or a stranger. Scientists found that the brain regions that correspond to threat responses were essentially activated equally under the threat to oneself or a close friend, but not to a stranger, which led them to believe that the human brain identify oneself with close others, virtually seeing oneself as the same as one's close friends."

Such cells could persist for a lifetime, churning out antibodies all the while.‚öÑ∫Last fall, there were reports that antibodies wane quickly after infection with the virus that causes COVID-19, and mainstream media interpreted that to mean that immunity was not long-lived,‚öÑπ said senior author Ali Ellebedy, PhD, an associate professor of pathology & immunology, of medicine and of molecular microbiology. ‚öÑ∫But that's a misinterpretation of the data. It's normal for antibody levels to go down after acute infection, but they don't go down to zero; they plateau. Here, we found antibody-producing cells in people 11 months after first symptoms. These cells will live and produce antibodies for the rest of people's lives. That's strong evidence for long-lasting immunity.‚öÑπ"

Controversial cases include accusations of hacking, arms dealing, and copywrite infringement. These are offenses however, not the serious crimes such as murder, rape, or fraud. Poor prison conditions are however the same, despite the seriousness of the crime committed, which is why, Mr. Mckinnin, who hacked into NASA, is believed to be at risk for suicide."

    "Assistant Professor Corey Lang at the University of Rhode Island has conducted a google search trends based research, which has been published in Springer's journal Climatic Change. It finds that, extreme weather conditions like change in winter temperatures, hot weather conditions result in increase search activity for global climate change. Deviation from regular weather patterns like an unexpected cold morning or a delay in snowy conditions are also associated with increased search activity. However there is a marked difference, based on their education level or political affiliations that they correlate these changes with global climate change. A google trends based research has found that less educated people and Republicans tend to search about weather and climate change only during extreme weather conditions, while the educated people and Democrats do it after experiencing changes in average temperatures. Summarily deviations in regular weather patterns do have an impact on searches related to climate change, but it depends on different types of people and their perceptions on the type of weather that qualifies as climate change."

    "On January 27, 1994, the Barbados national football team and Grenada national football team played against each other as part of the qualification round for the 1994 Caribbean Cup. Due to an unusual scoring rule and the two teams' respective positions in the tournament, it became alternately in the best interest of each team to score an own goal. The result has been described as \"one of the strangest football matches ever\"The organizers of the tournament had imposed a rule requiring all matches to have a winner, and this was enforced with an unusual variant of the golden goal rule: the first goal scored in extra-time not only won the match, but was also worth two goals. Barbados started the match needing to win by a margin of at least two goals to qualify for the final tournament, and after Grenada scored late in normal time to bring the scoreline to 2–1, Barbados deliberately scored an own goal to force extra-time, where they could get the two-goal winning margin they needed courtesy of the unconventional golden goal rule.[1] This resulted in an unusual situation: for the last three minutes of the match, Grenada was trying to score in both goals, as either outcome (3–2 or 2–3) would have advanced them to the finals, while Barbados had to defend both goals. Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the matchThe outcome of the match was criticized by Grenadian manager James Clarkson, who felt that his team had been cheated out of advancing to the finals. However, FIFA chose to not punish Barbados given the unusual tournament rules."

    "The global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2019 was 409.8 parts per million (ppm for short), with a range of uncertainty of plus or minus 0.1 ppm. Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in at least the past 800,000 years.In fact, the last time the atmospheric CO‚öáá amounts were this high was more than 3 million years ago, when temperature was 2¨‚àû–3¨‚àûC (3.6¨‚àû–5.4¨‚àûF) higher than during the pre-industrial era, and sea level was 15–25 meters (50–80 feet) higher than today.Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. According to State of the Climate in 2019 from NOAA and the American Meteorological Society, Global atmospheric carbon dioxide was 409.8 ± 0.1 ppm in 2019, a new record high. That is an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm from 2018, the same as the increase between 2017 and 2018. In the 1960s, the global growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.6 ± 0.1 ppm per year. Between 2009-18, however, the growth rate has been 2.3 ppm per year. The annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Warmed by sunlight, Earth's land and ocean surfaces continuously radiate thermal infrared energy (heat). Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb that heat and release it gradually over time, like bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out. Without this natural greenhouse effect, Earth's average annual temperature would be below freezing instead of close to 60¨‚àûF. But increases in greenhouse gases have tipped the Earth's energy budget out of balance, trapping additional heat and raising Earth's average temperature."

    "The organizers of the tournament had imposed a rule requiring all matches to have a winner, and this was enforced with an unusual variant of the golden goal rule: the first goal scored in extra-time not only won the match, but was also worth two goals. Barbados started the match needing to win by a margin of at least two goals to qualify for the final tournament, and after Grenada scored late in normal time to bring the scoreline to 2–1, Barbados deliberately scored an own goal to force extra-time, where they could get the two-goal winning margin they needed courtesy of the unconventional golden goal rule.[1] This resulted in an unusual situation: for the last three minutes of the match, Grenada was trying to score in both goals, as either outcome (3–2 or 2–3) would have advanced them to the finals, while Barbados had to defend both goals. Ultimately, Barbados was able to prevent Grenada from scoring, thus forcing extra-time, and scored the golden goal to win the match.The 1994 Caribbean Cup was the fifth edition of the Caribbean Cup and was played in Trinidad and Tobago. Qualification took place in various other locations around the Caribbean in early 1994.[3] At the time, FIFA had been testing variations on tournament rules,[4] and the tournament organizers had decided that any matches where the score was tied at the end of the normal 90 minutes would go to extra-time, which would feature a golden goal that, if scored, would be worth two goals.[1] Barbados, Grenada, and Puerto Rico were drawn into Group 1, and on January 23 the round-robin tournament kicked off in Barbados, with the home team falling 0–1 to Puerto Rico. Two days later, Grenada defeated Puerto Rico 2–0 after a golden goal in extra-time. This put Grenada at the top of the group with three points and a +2 goal difference.[3] Thus, the only way that Barbados could advance to the finals would be if they could beat Grenada by a margin of at least two goals."

    "The Criminal Justice system can be a complicated system to follow. For a crime victim and/or witness who is also coping with the crime and its effects, the entire process can be difficult and stressful.Further complicating matters is the fact that, once there is a conviction and the case is thought to be finished, the defendant ordinarily has the right to appeal.An appeal from a judgment in a federal criminal case is a request by the losing party to have the federal Court of Appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court review the decisions made in the district court. Many of the issues raised on appeal concern how the district court judge managed a trial or plea, or ruled at sentencing. In most criminal cases, an appeal is brought by a defendant after a court or jury finds him or her guilty.Appeals by the government are limited by the United States Constitution. The 5th Amendment's ‚öÑ∫double jeopardy‚öÑπ clause protects against multiple prosecutions for the same offense. Therefore, if the defendant is acquitted, the government cannot appeal.\n There are limited instances, however, when the government can appeal. The government may appeal court rulings which grant a defendant post-conviction relief (e.g., the reversal of a conviction). It may also appeal district court decisions on certain pre-trial motions (e.g., the suppression of evidence and sentencing issues).Appeals arising out of cases from the Federal district courts of Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana are handled by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, located in Chicago, Illinois. Criminal appellate procedure involves a set of rules and time limits which guide a case through the appellate process. This process begins when a defendant convicted at the district court level files a ‚öÑ∫Notice of Appeal.‚öÑπ The defendant's notice of appeal must usually be filed within ten days following the district court's entry of judgment. If the government is appealing the district court's decision, a timely notice of appeal may be filed within thirty days following entry of judgment.The defendant, now referred to as the ‚öÑ∫appellant,‚öÑπ must file an ‚öÑ∫appellant's brief.‚öÑπ A brief is a written legal argument which conveys the case to the court. On the average, it takes several months for a case to move from sentencing to the filing of the appellant's brief.The government then responds to the appellant's brief by filing an ‚öÑ∫appellee's‚öÑπ brief approximately thirty days thereafter. The appellee's brief is an answer to the challenge made by the defendant. The defendant may, within fourteen days thereafter, file an ‚öÑ∫appellant's reply brief‚öÑπ before the Court of Appeals considers the case.In most cases, following briefing, oral arguments are scheduled before a panel of three judges. An oral argument is an opportunity for each party's attorney to persuade the court and answer any questions from the judges. The argument, regarding the issues raised, usually lasts a total of 20 to 30 minutes. Only attorneys may address the court during oral arguments. Victims and/or witnesses may attend an oral argument which is open to the public. The defendant will not be present if he or she is in prison.After the Court of Appeals receives the briefs and has heard arguments, it may take several months or more to make a decision. Ultimately, the appellate court's final decision will either"

    "Family and marriage may at first seem to be familiar topics. Families exist in all societies and they are part of what makes us human. However, societies around the world demonstrate tremendous variation in cultural understandings of family and marriage. Ideas about how people are related to each other, what kind of marriage would be ideal, when people should have children, who should care for children, and many other family related matters differ cross-culturally. While the function of families is to fulfill basic human needs such as providing for children, defining parental roles, regulating sexuality, and passing property and knowledge between generations, there are many variations or patterns of family life that can meet these needs. This chapter introduces some of the more common patterns of family life found around the world. It is important to remember that within any cultural framework variation does occur. Some variations on the standard pattern fall within what would be culturally considered the ‚öÑ∫range of acceptable alternatives.‚öÑπ Other family forms are not entirely accepted, but would still be recognized by most members of the community as reasonable."

But 2021 has begun with a ray of hope: The beginning of vaccination drive around the world against COVID-19 is expected to gradually bring life back to some semblance of normalcy, and strengthen economic activity in a backdrop of supportive policy stance by most nations. The optimism is reflected in the projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). After a contraction of 3.5% in 2020, IMF expects the global economy to grow 5.5% in 2021 and 4.2% in 2022. The impact of COVID-19 has been severe across nations; however, nations are gradually working to recover.With a growth expectation of 11.5% in 2021, India is projected to be the fastest-growing trillion-dollar economy in the world. The decision to impose a complete lockdown in the first half of 2020 to combat the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a near-halt of its economic activities. Its negative impact was evident in two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, as a result of which India entered into a technical recession for the first time in its history. Overall, the country witnessed a contraction of 8% during 2020 according to the IMF. However, this is a temporary phase, and India is still a compelling growth story.The Union Budget presented on February 1, 2021 brought cheer to the markets and promises to focus on growth. Commending the Government of India on its Union Budget 2021-22, USISPF President and CEO Mukesh Aghi said, \"The Union Budget 2021-22 has taken into consideration the needs of all sectors of the economy, reflecting a robust growth plan for India to become a $5 trillion economy. Increased government spending in critical areas of the economy, such as agriculture, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and defense, has been much needed.\""

    "The Criminal Justice system can be a complicated system to follow. For a crime victim and/or witness who is also coping with the crime and its effects, the entire process can be difficult and stressful.Further complicating matters is the fact that, once there is a conviction and the case is thought to be finished, the defendant ordinarily has the right to appeal.An appeal from a judgment in a federal criminal case is a request by the losing party to have the federal Court of Appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court review the decisions made in the district court. Many of the issues raised on appeal concern how the district court judge managed a trial or plea, or ruled at sentencing. In most criminal cases, an appeal is brought by a defendant after a court or jury finds him or her guilty.Appeals by the government are limited by the United States Constitution. The 5th Amendment's ‚öÑ∫double jeopardy‚öÑπ clause protects against multiple prosecutions for the same offense. Therefore, if the defendant is acquitted, the government cannot appeal.\n There are limited instances, however, when the government can appeal. The government may appeal court rulings which grant a defendant post-conviction relief (e.g., the reversal of a conviction). It may also appeal district court decisions on certain pre-trial motions (e.g., the suppression of evidence and sentencing issues).Appeals arising out of cases from the Federal district courts of Wisconsin, Illinois and Indiana are handled by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, located in Chicago, Illinois. Criminal appellate procedure involves a set of rules and time limits which guide a case through the appellate process. This process begins when a defendant convicted at the district court level files a ‚öÑ∫Notice of Appeal.‚öÑπ The defendant's notice of appeal must usually be filed within ten days following the district court's entry of judgment. If the government is appealing the district court's decision, a timely notice of appeal may be filed within thirty days following entry of judgment.The defendant, now referred to as the ‚öÑ∫appellant,‚öÑπ must file an ‚öÑ∫appellant's brief.‚öÑπ A brief is a written legal argument which conveys the case to the court. On the average, it takes several months for a case to move from sentencing to the filing of the appellant's brief.The government then responds to the appellant's brief by filing an ‚öÑ∫appellee's‚öÑπ brief approximately thirty days thereafter. The appellee's brief is an answer to the challenge made by the defendant. The defendant may, within fourteen days thereafter, file an ‚öÑ∫appellant's reply brief‚öÑπ before the Court of Appeals considers the case.In most cases, following briefing, oral arguments are scheduled before a panel of three judges. An oral argument is an opportunity for each party's attorney to persuade the court and answer any questions from the judges. The argument, regarding the issues raised, usually lasts a total of 20 to 30 minutes. Only attorneys may address the court during oral arguments. Victims and/or witnesses may attend an oral argument which is open to the public. The defendant will not be present if he or she is in prison.After the Court of Appeals receives the briefs and has heard arguments, it may take several months or more to make a decision. Ultimately, the appellate court's final decision will either"

    "Measles was eliminated in the United States in 2000. High national coverage with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and rapid implementation of measles control measures prevent widespread measles transmission.During January–September 2019, 1,249 U.S. measles cases were reported, the highest annual number since 1992. Eighty-nine percent of measles patients were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status, and 10% were hospitalized. Eighty-six percent of cases were associated with outbreaks in underimmunized, close-knit communities, including two outbreaks in New York Orthodox Jewish communities that threatened measles elimination status in the United States.During January 1–October 1, 2019, a total of 1,249 measles cases and 22 measles outbreaks were reported in the United States. This represents the most U.S. cases reported in a single year since 1992 (1), and the second highest number of reported outbreaks annually since measles was declared eliminated* in the United States in 2000 (2). Measles is an acute febrile rash illness with an attack rate of approximately 90% in susceptible household contacts (3). Domestic outbreaks can occur when travelers contract measles outside the United States and subsequently transmit infection to unvaccinated persons they expose in the United States. Among the 1,249 measles cases reported in 2019, 1,163 (93%) were associated with the 22 outbreaks, 1,107 (89%) were in patients who were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status, and 119 (10%) measles patients were hospitalized. Closely related outbreaks in New York City (NYC) and New York State (NYS; excluding NYC), with ongoing transmission for nearly 1 year in large and close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities, accounted for 934 (75%) cases during 2019 and threatened the elimination status of measles in the United States. Robust responses in NYC and NYS were effective in controlling transmission before the 1-year mark; however, continued vigilance for additional cases within these communities is essential to determine whether elimination has been sustained. Collaboration between public health authorities and undervaccinated communities is important for preventing outbreaks and limiting transmission. The combination of maintenance of high national vaccination coverage with measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) and rapid implementation of measles control measures remains the cornerstone for preventing widespread measles transmission (4)."

Clinton argued that in the 52 years since 1961, during which Republicans held the House for twenty eight years and the Democrats for 24, the latter produced 42 million jobs compared to the former's 24 million, and despite the small numerical discrepancies, Clinton's ratio held water. Many wondered if Romney would be responsible for Medicare's bankruptcy by 2016, but Republicans have been disadvantaged by the recessions that plagued their administrations. Clinton's ratio is more like 44.7 million jobs to 23.3 million, but there still remains significant controversy amongst economists over proper praise or blame with regard to job creation under Republican or Democratic administrations."

See OAR 734-020-0011 for all designated speeds.In addition, Oregon Revised Statute (ORS 811.111 subsection 2-12) establishes different statutory speeds than those shown above for specific sections of rural highways and interstates in eastern Oregon. Although these highways and interstates may have some segments with designated speeds, they generally have posted speed limits as follows:American law follows the basic idea that most people are reasonable and laws exist to control the few who are unreasonable or inconsiderate. The posted speed zones follow the same idea.Studies performed in Oregon and throughout the United States serve as the basis for how we establish speed zones. These studies show that traffic moving at a speed reasonable for the road and weather conditions results in fewer crashes. Drivers are more patient because a reasonably uniform speed allows progress with less passing, less delay, and fewer rear-end collisions."

    "he year 2020 has been one of the toughest years for humanity. It saw global challenges to our ways of life, our governments, and our economies. But 2021 has begun with a ray of hope: The beginning of vaccination drive around the world against COVID-19 is expected to gradually bring life back to some semblance of normalcy, and strengthen economic activity in a backdrop of supportive policy stance by most nations. The optimism is reflected in the projections by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). After a contraction of 3.5% in 2020, IMF expects the global economy to grow 5.5% in 2021 and 4.2% in 2022. The impact of COVID-19 has been severe across nations; however, nations are gradually working to recover.With a growth expectation of 11.5% in 2021, India is projected to be the fastest-growing trillion-dollar economy in the world. The decision to impose a complete lockdown in the first half of 2020 to combat the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a near-halt of its economic activities. Its negative impact was evident in two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, as a result of which India entered into a technical recession for the first time in its history. Overall, the country witnessed a contraction of 8% during 2020 according to the IMF. However, this is a temporary phase, and India is still a compelling growth story.The Union Budget presented on February 1, 2021 brought cheer to the markets and promises to focus on growth. Commending the Government of India on its Union Budget 2021-22, USISPF President and CEO Mukesh Aghi said, \"The Union Budget 2021-22 has taken into consideration the needs of all sectors of the economy, reflecting a robust growth plan for India to become a $5 trillion economy. Increased government spending in critical areas of the economy, such as agriculture, infrastructure, healthcare, education, and defense, has been much needed.\""

    "Because the 1897 flood is often used as a measure of other Red River Valley floods, a description of it at Fargo and Grand Forks was included in a 1952 U.S. Geological Survey Water Supply Paper. Text from that description is reprinted below.The present indications are that we will have high water this spring, as high if not higher, than it was in the spring of 1861. If all reports are true there is more snow on the level now than there was in the spring of 1861. That year the entire valley was flooded from Big Stone Lake to Winnipeg, a distance of more than 300 miles. There are but four men living in the valley now that witnessed the great flood of '61 -- the largest body of fresh water in the world at that time * * * R. M. Probesfield is authority for saying that he, a few days ago, measured the snow in his timber, where it was free from drifting and it measured 5 feet. This measurement is two and one-half feet more snow than we had in 1861. Those facts prove that we will have a greater flood this year than in the history of the valley. Old Settler.The flood forecast by \"Old Settler\" was not long delayed. The Red crested at Wahpeton on March 31, 2' 8\" above the 1893 high. By April 1, 1897, the C. M. St. P. & P. Railway tracks between Fargo and Wahpeton were covered with water in spots and traffic was suspended. By April 2 the Buffalo River overflowed so a large lake was formed between Glyndon and Moorhead. The Wild Rice (N. Dak.) River was described as 'on a splurge too'. The Sheyenne River was reported rising slowly at Valley City on April 3. The Red crested early on the morning of April 7 at Fargo at 34.2 foot stage (present [1952] datum) exceeding the known high levels of 1871, 1873, and 1882. The Sheyenne River, by April 8, was up so high that water flowed overland from it to the Wild Rice River. The flood of 1897 at Fargo covered most of the business and residential areas of the city."

    "When you make a purchase and pay with your credit card, you don't actually pay money to the merchant. Rather, the merchant is paid by your credit card company. Once the transaction is approved by your card issuer, your available credit goes down. Even though the merchant has been paid, you aren't billed by the credit card company until later.You can't pay a credit card with a credit card directly, but you might be able to pay a credit card with cash from another card. Let's say you have two credit cards, Card A and Card B. You can't afford to make your minimum payment on Card A, so you're looking to Card B for a little help.If you use your debit card to overdraw your bank account on a regular basis or do so and leave the negative balance long-term, it could negatively impact your credit score. Banks do report checking and savings details like this to the credit bureaus. The Bottom Line on Debit Cards as Credit Cards.If the transfer is considered a cash advance transaction (and it usually will be), then you'll pay a fee worth around 3% of the total you send to your bank account. Cash advance interest rate. In most cases, your transfer will be charged interest at the cash advance rate.A refund for a returned item will not usually post to your credit card account instantly.Instead it generally takes several business days, and potentially even up to a week, before a refunded purchase will appear on your credit card ledger and affect your card balance. Generally, when a refund is processed for a returned item within the same credit card billing cycle, you won't be held responsible to make a payment on that specific charge.If you were to return a purchase near or after the end of your billing cycle, the refund for the transaction might not show on your account before your next credit card payment is due. Regardless of the timing of the purchase and the return, if you fail to make at least the minimum payment on your account prior to the due date then you could be penalized by your credit card company in the form of a late fee. You can't skip making a minimum payment if there is any amount due to the card issuer, even if you expect to get a refund."
