      "article": "The president of the World Bank on Saturday warned the United States was just 'days away' from causing a global economic disaster unless politicians come up with a plan to raise the nation's debt limit and avoid default. 'We're now five days away from a very dangerous moment. I urge US policymakers to quickly come to a resolution before they reach the debt ceiling deadline... Inaction could result in interest rates rising, confidence falling and growth slowing,' World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in a briefing following a meeting of the bank's Development Committee. 'If this comes to pass, it could be a disastrous event for the developing world, and that will in turn greatly hurt developed economies as well,' he said. Scroll down for video . Disastrous: World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim warned Saturday that the United States was headed toward peril as politicians failed again to resolve a standoff over the budget . The alarming remarks from the Korean-American came after three days of talks revolving around meetings of the 188-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister lending agency, the World Bank, where top officials pressed the US to resolve the political impasse over the debt ceiling. The standoff has blocked approval of legislation to increase the government's borrowing limit before a fast-approaching Thursday deadline. US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has warned that he will exhaust his borrowing authority on Thursday and the government will face the prospect of defaulting on its debt unless Congress raises the $16.7 trillion borrowing limit. 'We know there are problems,' Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the head of the IMF's policy-steering committee and Singapore's finance minister, told a news conference at the end of the IMF meeting. 'We know there are near-term risks, the most obvious one being what's going on in the US with regard to the fiscal deficit.' But one of the big near-term concerns, the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will start scaling back its massive stimulus program for the economy, is actually pointing to a positive development, Tharman said. Talks: Jim Yong Kim, (left), president, World Bank Group, and Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director, talk before a meeting of the Development Committee during the World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings in Washington . It means that the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand a reduction of the stimulus. IMF officials have been forecasting that the strengthening U.S. economy will be a main driver of the global economy in the coming year. At the same time, developing country economies are slowing and their markets have been unsettled since May by anticipation that the Fed will soon begin tapering its $85-billion-a-month bond purchases, which poured cash into the economy to stimulate growth. 'The eventual normalisation of monetary policy as economies recover in the West will be a net positive for the emerging economies,' Tharman said, meaning that the strength of the major economies would help carry the global economy forward. Lew told finance ministers that the US understood the role it played as 'the anchor of the international financial system', and assured them the administration was doing all it could to reach a resolution on the debt. Stalemate: Speaker of the House John Boehner walks to his office after a meeting with fellow Republicans at the Capitol in Washington on Saturday . An effort Saturday to pass a one-year extension of the borrowing limit failed to get sufficient votes. But in a more hopeful sign, negotiations began between Democratic and Republican Senate leaders to end the impasse. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, was one of a number of officials who were guardedly confident that an eleventh-hour deal would be reached, as it has in similar standoffs in the past. 'I still think it is unthinkable that an agreement won't be found,' Draghi told reporters on Saturday. 'If this situation were to last a long time, it would be very negative for the U.S. economy and the world economy and could certainly harm the recovery.' But once Draghi moved beyond the US impasse, he sounded upbeat about the prospects for a European recovery. That in itself is a dramatic turn from the past three years, when global financial leaders were taken up with waves of crisis sweeping across the region and necessitating a series of international rescue loans. Business not as usual: President Barack Obama yesterday discussed challenges from the partial government shutdown small business owners . The IMF called on emerging economies, which have been the drivers of the global economy in recent years, to undertake reforms that will help their economies better withstand the scaling back of monetary stimulus in the U.S. and other major economies. When the stimulus money was flowing, emerging economies benefited from investments as investors were attracted by their relatively higher rates of interest vis-a-vis the United States and other major economies. But many of those same countries that benefited from capital flows have been rocked since May, as the investment flows reversed and flowed back toward the US as rates here began to rise. Alexandre Tombini, the head Brazil's central bank, told the IMF steering committee that the worries about the US and global economies might be overblown. 'A while ago there was an excess of exuberance and now perhaps an excess of pessimism,' he said. Negotiating: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada is surrounded by reporters as he leaves the Senate floor to meet with Senate Democrats regarding the government shutdown and debt ceiling . Time is ticking: Republican Senator from Kentucky Mitch McConnell walks off the Senate floor after a vote on the motion to proceed on the Debt Limit Bill . The stark warnings from the World Bank came the same day that House Speaker John Boehner today told fellow Republicans that his talks with President Barack Obama have stalled. 'The Senate needs to hold tough,' Representative Greg Walden said Boehner told House GOP lawmakers. 'The president now isn't negotiating with us.' Obama rejected the speaker's effort to lift the debt ceiling for six weeks and reopen government in exchange for a budget negotiating process. Attention now turns to the Senate, where a bipartisan group of Senators are working on a separate plan to reopen the government. New plan: Republican Senator from Maine Susan Collins leaves a Republican meeting and heads to the Senate floor to vote on the motion to proceed on the Debt Limit Bill . Word of the negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and the top Republican, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, emerged as the Senate, as expected, rejected a Democratic effort to raise the government's borrowing limit through next year. Republicans objected because they want the extension to be accompanied by spending cuts. The calendar is edging closer to the October 17 deadline to raise the federal debt ceiling. After that, administration officials have said the government will deplete its ability to borrow money, risking a first-time federal default that could jolt the world economy.",

Manchester City are the best-paid sports team in the world, with average first-team pay a whopping £5.3m a year, or £102,653 per week according to a new report that compares global earnings in the most popular leagues. Five Premier League sides make the top 20 on the list, with Liverpool - City's title showdown opponents from Sunday - in 20th place, earning an average of £3.4m per man per year. Manchester United are at No 8 on £4.3m per man per year, Champions League semi-finalists Chelsea are at No 10 (nearly £4m) and Arsenal are at No 11 (£3.9m). Scroll down to see the table of the world's highest-paid sports teams . High earners: Manchester City have topped a global sports salary list, with their squad paid £5.3m a year . Big spender: City owner Sheik Mansour has invested hundreds of millions into making them title challengers . Blank cheque: Manuel Pellegrini could sign pretty much any player in the world for City . Two giants from American baseball, the New York Yankees and the LA Dodgers, as well as the two giants of Spanish football, Real Madrid and Barcelona, fill out the top five behind City. The top 10 also includes the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA (at No 6), Bayern Munich (No 7), and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA (No 9). The Global Sports Salaries Survey (GSSS), produced for ESPN The Magazine in the USA, has been tracking comparative pay at major sports teams for five years. City players were earning an average of just under £1.5m a year each when Sheik Mansour arrived in 2008 but their pay has more than trebled in the six years of his ownership. Chelsea have also seen their wages and . fortunes soar since Roman Abramovich arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2003 . but foreign sugar-daddy ownership is not restricted to elite European . football.

Not only is Prokhorov footing the Nets' $102m (around £61m) total payroll in 2013-14, or £4.5m per player this year, but he will need to pay an additional $70m (around £42m) or thereabouts in luxury tax for exceeding the NBA's wage cap.

U.S. officials believe the drone Iran is referring to may be the same one, but the U.S. government has not confirmed that it was shot down, the source said. The RQ-170 Sentinel is a stealth drone developed for the Air Force to help provide intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance.

The official said the drone's mission was to fly over Afghanistan. American officials over the years have been adamant that U.S. assets do not fly over Iranian air space.

The court's Monday ruling means Sandra Torres, who divorced Guatemala's current president in an attempt to circumvent a nepotism law, has now exhausted her appeals. The seven justices voted unanimously that Torres was not eligible to be on the ballot because close relatives of the president are constitutionally barred from running. Three of the judges had additional arguments for the decision. Their decision upheld a Supreme Court of Justice ruling issued last month. Torres slammed the ruling Tuesday, saying it left Guatemala's neediest citizens without anyone to represent them in the country's highest office. \"Without any legal basis, they made decisions that were political, not legal,\" she told reporters Tuesday. \"For me, it is anti-democratic, this political lynching, this lynching in the media,\" she added. Torres filed for divorce from President Alvaro Colom on March 11; the divorce was finalized in April. The country's Supreme Court ruled last month that the divorce was used to avoid the constitutional prohibition, and that in trying to get around the law, Torres committed fraud. She appealed to the Constitutional Court, which has final say in all constitutional matters. The Constitutional Court said that Torres was a close relative of the president and thus not eligible to run, but it dissented by rejecting that legal fraud had occurred. Some followers of Torres, who were gathered outside the court, cried when they heard the news. Torres said Tuesday that she had not decided whether to support another presidential candidate. She urged her followers to support congressional and mayoral candidates from the coalition of parties behind her candidacy, saying they would protect social programs. In her statement before the Constitutional Court last week, Torres accused the supreme court of having politicized justice. More than 1.7 million Guatemalans had signed a petition saying they wanted her as a candidate, she said, arguing that the people's voice should be heard. \"Democracy is built with more democracy,\" she told the judges. In her argument she reiterated that she was \"not married to anyone\" and suggested that there was discrimination against her because of her gender. Torres, 55, is a former businesswoman and clothing exporter. She was the candidate of the coalition of the National Unity for Hope Party (UNE) and the Grand National Alliance (GANA). The end to her candidacy could boost the presidential aspirations of the front-runner, retired Gen. Otto Perez Molina of the Patriotic Party. According to a Prodatos poll released in late July, 37.6% of those surveyed said they would vote for Perez Molina in the September 11 elections. Torres came in second with 17.2% of the vote. The poll also asked who they would vote for if Torres' candidacy was rejected. With Torres out, Perez Molina's numbers rose to 41.2%, and former congressman Manuel Baldizon, of the Democratic Renovated Liberty Party (Lider), was a distant second with 13.6%.",

      "article": "Washington (CNN) -- Fire-protection systems on freight aircraft are inadequate, top U.S. aviation investigators say. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended improvements and rule changes Wednesday based on investigations of three catastrophic cargo plane fires. NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration require better early detection of fires inside cargo containers, development of fire-resistant containers and requiring active fire-suppression systems on all freight airlines. An NTSB report focused on three cargo fire accidents since 2006. Two of those fires killed the flight crews and destroyed the aircraft, in incidents in Dubai and North Korea. In the third incident in Philadelphia, the crew escaped with minor smoke-inhalation difficulties, and the plane was significantly damaged. \"These fires quickly grew out of control, leaving the crew with little time to get the aircraft on the ground,\" Hersman said in a statement released with the report. \"Detection, suppression and containment systems can give crews more time and more options. The current approach is not safe enough.\" FAA budget cuts would affect fliers . In all three cases, the fires started within the cargo containers aboard the planes, but by the time the plane's fire warning system alerted pilots to the dangers, there was little time for them to react. Federal regulations require cargo airline fire detection systems to alert pilots within one minute of a fire starting, but the NTSB's investigation found current systems detected fire and smoke anywhere from two and half minutes to more than 18 minutes after the fire started. The NTSB concluded cargo containers made of flammable materials significantly increase the intensity of the on-board fires because there's been little focus by manufacturers or regulators to develop fire-resistant cargo containers. Additionally, the NTSB's report recommended improved fire suppression systems on cargo planes, a recommendation it originally made to the FAA in 2007. After the 2007 recommendation, the FAA did a cost-benefit analysis of upgrading fire suppression systems and found it to be too expensive, a fact the NTSB highlighted in its report. \"The two catastrophic cargo airplane fires that occurred in less than a year occurred after the FAA's cost-benefit analysis concluded that the installation of fire suppression systems was not cost-effective,\" the board said. UPS briefed Hersman earlier this week on the shipping company's efforts to develop improved fire safety standards. Also, FedEx is in the process of installing a fire suppression system on its long-haul fleet, the NTSB said. In an e-mail statement to CNN, FAA officials said the agency \"has long supported improved fire protection on all cargo airplanes through research on new, non-Halon fire extinguishing agents, fire suppression systems directed at individual cargo containers or specific cargo compartment zones, and advanced cargo containers incorporating smoke detection, fire containment, and/or fire suppression systems.\" FAA officials said they would carefully evaluate the NTSB's recommendations.

Ernst Berlin (pictured with his nine-month-old son Jacob), from Chicago, has given his wife Agnes a birthday present she will never forget - after commissioning 23 artists to create unique works of art of his family . The artworks were each based on various photographs of the family supplied to the 23 artists for inspiration . Mr Berlin, 33, asked 50 artists to paint a picture of his son Jacob (above) and was pleased that 23 responded .

Baby Bond: The images came in over a period months - and Mr Berlin liked them all, so he hung them all up . To his surprise, 23 artists replied. Ernst, whose nine-month-old son Jacob would also feature in the pictures, said he liked all of their works so much he couldn't turn them down. As an amateur photographer, Ernst, 33, decided to send the artists a selection of 40 pictures of his family, allowing them to choose which they would like to work with. Over a period of a few months, the images kept coming in. When her birthday came around, Ernst treated Agnes, now 34, to a three-hour-long spa treatment - allowing him to hang the works on the wall while she was out. Agnes' reaction was one of shock, with Ernst filming her response and later putting it on YouTube for friends and family to see. Mr Berlin, an amateur photographer, found the artists on website Reddit, and after initially asking the group if anyone was interested, was surprised when submissions kept coming in over a period of several months . Mr Berlin's nine-month-old son Jacob became the star of the show - and featured in the majority of the pieces . The artists chose from 40 pictures altogether, such as this cute image of Jacob resting on his mother's belly . After receiving the final artworks back from the artists, Mr Berlin hung them around the house for his wife . Mr Berlin, 33, said: 'I was worried about not finishing it in time, but luckily it all worked out' One of the artists chose to recreate this picture of Agnes and Jacob in hospital just after he was born . Mr Berlin sent a selection of adorable pictures to the artists, including this one of nine-month-old Jacob . He then waited over a period of several months for the artists' own creations to be returned to him . Jacob features in the majority of the artworks, which were given to his surprised mother on her birthday . Mr Berlin said the response to his idea from his family and friends has been overwhelmingly positive . The idea to approach the artists was a 'light bulb moment', according to Mr Berlin.

Mr Berlin, his wife Agnes and their son Jacob could be seen having fun in a park in one of the photographs .

      "article": "There has been a great deal spoken about the sweltering heat and humidity England will face in Manaus when they play Italy on Saturday night. But how does it actually feel to run and exercise in such testing conditions? With the help of a Battersea Park biodome, an industrial-sized heater and a treadmill, Adam Shergold found out. It takes less than 10 seconds for the first bead of sweat to start trickling its way down from my forehead, off the tip of my nose and on to my soon-to-be-saturated shirt. It's a little disheartening for someone who considers themselves fairly fit, and is currently in training for a half-marathon, to be perspiring so uncontrollably after just a minute or so of exercise. Feeling the heat: Sportsmail's Adam Shergold gets going on the treadmill inside a biodome that replicates the hot and humid conditions England will experience when they face Italy in Manaus on Saturday night . Ramp it up: As our man reaches full speed on the treadmill, the 30C heat and 80 per cent humidity starts to take its toll . Venue: The Arena da Amazonia will host England's first World Cup match, against Italy on Saturday evening . Ready, boys? England have been gradually acclimatising to the hot conditions in Brazil . But then the sweltering conditions of Manaus have no mercy on anyone, not even the super-fit elite footballers who will play there during the World Cup. I'm running on a treadmill in a Biodome set up by Ladbrokes in Battersea Park to replicate the extreme conditions England will encounter when they step out to play Italy at the Arena Amazonia on Saturday week. Outside, the late Spring day is grey and drizzly but this 'Mini-Manaus' feels like a pressure-cooker as industrial-sized heaters relentlessly circulate chokingly hot air. The hard yards: Shergold winds down after running for 10 minutes in the 'Mini-Manaus' biodome built by Ladbrokes in Battersea Park . Welcome refreshment: The cold water is very much necessary after completing the 'Mini-Manaus' challenge . The thermometer reads 31C, the average temperature in Manaus at this time of year, and the humidity sits just above the 80 per cent mark. These are conditions in which even walking down the street is an effort, so playing 90 minutes of high-intensity football is not an attractive option. I manage about 10 minutes of running on the treadmill, working up from a walk to an all-out sprint, before the temptation to throw water all over myself becomes too great. Each match at the World Cup will factor in drinks breaks, and these will be absolutely essential for the players to take on water or an energy drink and rehydrate. Warmer climes: A game of football being played on the beach in Manaus . Flavour of the Amazon: Shergold outside the heated biodome built in Battersea Park to replicate the sweltering, tropical conditions in Manaus . The paramedic on standby at the Biodome measures my core body temperature at a normal 37.2C before stepping on the treadmill. At the end, it's nudging above 38C, the kind of level when you're suffering from a fever. It's a relief to step outside the dome again, into the cooling London drizzle, and I have plenty of sympathy for the England players who will have to cope with these energy-sapping conditions while carrying the weight of the nation's expectation.

Ramp it up: As our man reaches full speed on the treadmill, the 30C heat and 80 per cent humidity starts to take its toll . Venue: The Arena da Amazonia will host England's first World Cup match, against Italy on Saturday evening . Ready, boys? England have been gradually acclimatising to the hot conditions in Brazil . But then the sweltering conditions of Manaus have no mercy on anyone, not even the super-fit elite footballers who will play there during the World Cup. I'm running on a treadmill in a Biodome set up by Ladbrokes in Battersea Park to replicate the extreme conditions England will encounter when they step out to play Italy at the Arena Amazonia on Saturday week. Outside, the late Spring day is grey and drizzly but this 'Mini-Manaus' feels like a pressure-cooker as industrial-sized heaters relentlessly circulate chokingly hot air. The hard yards: Shergold winds down after running for 10 minutes in the 'Mini-Manaus' biodome built by Ladbrokes in Battersea Park . Welcome refreshment: The cold water is very much necessary after completing the 'Mini-Manaus' challenge . The thermometer reads 31C, the average temperature in Manaus at this time of year, and the humidity sits just above the 80 per cent mark. These are conditions in which even walking down the street is an effort, so playing 90 minutes of high-intensity football is not an attractive option. I manage about 10 minutes of running on the treadmill, working up from a walk to an all-out sprint, before the temptation to throw water all over myself becomes too great. Each match at the World Cup will factor in drinks breaks, and these will be absolutely essential for the players to take on water or an energy drink and rehydrate. Warmer climes: A game of football being played on the beach in Manaus . Flavour of the Amazon: Shergold outside the heated biodome built in Battersea Park to replicate the sweltering, tropical conditions in Manaus . The paramedic on standby at the Biodome measures my core body temperature at a normal 37.2C before stepping on the treadmill. At the end, it's nudging above 38C, the kind of level when you're suffering from a fever. It's a relief to step outside the dome again, into the cooling London drizzle, and I have plenty of sympathy for the England players who will have to cope with these energy-sapping conditions while carrying the weight of the nation's expectation.

      "article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A pressurized cylinder exploded at Universal Studios on Sunday, injuring two firefighters as they tried to fight a blaze that began earlier in the day, Los Angeles authorities said. The fire destroyed buildings and movie sets at Universal Studios on Sunday. Eight other firefighters were injured in the fire, which was expected to be contained by 4:15 p.m. (7:15 p.m. ET), said Ron Haralson, an inspector with the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The explosion occurred about 2:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. ET) near the video vault of the Universal Studios back lot. The vault was damaged. The fast-moving, early morning blaze destroyed several movie sets and the King Kong exhibit. Even so, officials still planned to go ahead with the 2008 MTV Movie Awards show at the site -- just north of downtown Los Angeles, adjacent to the Universal Studios theme park. \"The areas we are utilizing for our production were unaffected and the 2008 MTV Movie Awards will go on as planned. We're working closely with authorities to make sure everything operates smoothly,\" an MTV spokesman said in a statement. The awards show will bring a parade of A-list stars to the park's CityWalk area.

But Leeds' bosses claim that they are still owed more than £800,000, Sir David Eady was told. The figures emerged on Friday after the judge examined the latest stage of the dispute between West Yorkshire Police and Leeds. Overharged: West Yorkshire Police have been ordered to pay Leeds £1.2m . Two years ago Eady ruled that the force overcharged for 'special police services' over three seasons between 2009 and 2012, following a High Court hearing. West Yorkshire Police and Leeds are now arguing over how exactly much should be repaid. The judge on Friday revealed detail of developments in the case in a written analysis following a further High Court hearing in London in June. 'In July 2012, I ruled that Leeds United Football Club had been charged for special police services over the three preceding football seasons, in respect of home matches, on a basis that was in part unlawful,' Eady said.

Joe Biden on Tuesday, saying the Democratic vice presidential nominee had \"sunk to a new low\" by raising a debate over who cares more for special needs children. Sen. Joseph Biden embraces a supporter during a campaign stop in Columbia, Missouri, on Tuesday. The Republican camp's sharp response came after Biden said GOP advocates for children with birth defects should support stem cell research. During a campaign event in Columbia, Missouri, Biden did not mention his Republican counterpart by name but said, \"I hear all this talk about how the Republicans are going to work in dealing with parents who have both the joy ... and the difficulty of raising a child who has a developmental disability, who were born with a birth defect.\" Biden's support of stem cell research is at odds with the position taken by the Republicans' vice presidential nominee, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, whose 5-month-old son, Trig, has Down syndrome. Palin, an evangelical Christian, opposes stem cell research because it involves the use of human embryos, but her running mate, GOP presidential nominee McCain, does support stem cell research. \"Well, guess what, folks? If you care about it, why don't you support stem cell research?\" asked Biden, the running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama. Those comments brought a sharp response. \"Barack Obama's running mate sunk to a new low today, launching an offensive debate over who cares more about special needs children,\" McCain-Palin spokesman Ben Porritt said. \"Playing politics with this issue is disturbing and indicative of a desperate campaign.\" Biden spokesman David Wade insisted that the Delaware senator's comments were not directed at Palin. \"This is a clash of policies, not a clash of personalities,\" Wade said. \"We've heard not a dime's worth of difference between the McCain-Palin ticket and the Bush administration on medical breakthroughs that millions of parents and doctors believe could save lives and transform the quality of life for countless Americans.\" During her acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last week, Palin told parents of children with disabilities that she would be \"a friend and advocate in the White House.\" But the Alaska governor's support for the disabled has come under scrutiny since McCain chose Palin to be his running mate nearly two weeks ago.

Investigators dropped the charge because they say the suspect, Kevin Edson, 25, did not communicate an \"overt threat that an incendiary device would be detonated,\" Jake Wark, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney, told CNN. Edson was arrested after carrying the backpack with a rice cooker near the finish line on Boylston Street in Boston while survivors of the 2013 bombing were commemorating its anniversary on April 15. In the 2013 attack, two pressure-cooker bombs exploded, killing three people and wounding at least 264 others. A barefoot Edson, carrying a backpack and wearing black clothes with a veil and hat covering his face, screamed and yelled near the end of the anniversary event on Boylston Street, drawing officers' attention, police said. Wark said prosecutors decided to drop the charge after reviewing statements Edson made at the scene as well as video shot by onlookers. Edson still faces charges of disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, disturbing a public assembly and possession or use of a hoax device. His next court date is scheduled for August 27. The charge of making a false bomb threat carried the most severe sentence upon conviction -- up to 20 years in prison. Possession or use of a hoax device carries a maximum sentence of five years, Wark said. A judge in April set bail at $100,000 for Edson.

      "article": "COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- The United States faces a Zimbabwe-style economic collapse if it keeps \"spending a bunch of money we don't have,\" South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford said Wednesday. South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford says he does not want to spend money that his state doesn't have. Sanford, a Republican, has been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration's $800 billion stimulus plan. He said he'll turn down about a quarter of his state's $2.8 billion share unless Washington lets him use that money to pay down debt. \"What you're doing is buying into the notion that if we just print some more money that we don't have and send it to different states, we'll create jobs,\" he said. \"If that's the case, why isn't Zimbabwe a rich place?\" Zimbabwe has been in the throes of an economic meltdown ever since the southern African nation embarked on a chaotic land reform program. Its official inflation rate topped 11 million percent in 2008, with its treasury printing banknotes in the trillion-dollar range to keep up with the plummeting value of its currency. But with South Carolina's unemployment rate now the second-highest in the country, state lawmakers will attempt to override Sanford and take the $700 million if he turns it down, Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer said. \"They will use the total economic stimulus to stimulate the economy, jump-start it, so we can get out of the ditch we are in as a state and as a nation,\" Bauer, a fellow Republican, said in a written statement Wednesday. Labor Department figures released Wednesday showed South Carolina's January unemployment rate hit 10.4 percent, second only to Michigan's 11.6 percent. Sanford is one of several Republican governors who have criticized the nearly $800 billion stimulus package, which passed with minimal GOP support in the Senate and none in the House of Representatives. Other governors, such as California Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger or Michigan Democrat Jennifer Granholm, have said they would take any money Republican-led states reject. But Sanford told reporters that taking the money now would leave the state in the lurch in two years, \"when those funds dry up.\" \"Fundamentally, if you boil down what the stimulus means for South Carolina, it means we would go through the process of spending a bunch of money we don't have,\" he said. The stimulus measure allows state legislatures to override governors and take the money -- a provision championed by South Carolina congressman James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House. Clyburn said Sanford is unlikely to get any waiver from the administration, and he called the governor's announcement \"100 percent political posturing.\" \"This recovery package is designed to stabilize communities, to save and create jobs, and help our economy get back in a growth mode,\" he told reporters. \"And you don't do that by paying down debt that's been incurred over a long period of time.\" And Bauer said that if South Carolina turns down the money, \"South Carolina taxpayers will be taking on the debt for economic stimulus money sent elsewhere.\" Sanford has been called a potential GOP presidential contender in 2012, but he told CNN that the next election is \"not where I'm focused.\" \"I don't rule anything in, I don't rule anything out,\" he said, adding, \"If anything came along like that, it would be an incredibly long shot.\"",
