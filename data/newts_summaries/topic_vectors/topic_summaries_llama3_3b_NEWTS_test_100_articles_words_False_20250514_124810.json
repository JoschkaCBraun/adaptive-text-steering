      "article": "The president of the World Bank on Saturday warned the United States was just 'days away' from causing a global economic disaster unless politicians come up with a plan to raise the nation's debt limit and avoid default. 'We're now five days away from a very dangerous moment. I urge US policymakers to quickly come to a resolution before they reach the debt ceiling deadline... Inaction could result in interest rates rising, confidence falling and growth slowing,' World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in a briefing following a meeting of the bank's Development Committee. 'If this comes to pass, it could be a disastrous event for the developing world, and that will in turn greatly hurt developed economies as well,' he said. Scroll down for video . Disastrous: World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim warned Saturday that the United States was headed toward peril as politicians failed again to resolve a standoff over the budget . The alarming remarks from the Korean-American came after three days of talks revolving around meetings of the 188-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister lending agency, the World Bank, where top officials pressed the US to resolve the political impasse over the debt ceiling. The standoff has blocked approval of legislation to increase the government's borrowing limit before a fast-approaching Thursday deadline. US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has warned that he will exhaust his borrowing authority on Thursday and the government will face the prospect of defaulting on its debt unless Congress raises the $16.7 trillion borrowing limit. 'We know there are problems,' Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the head of the IMF's policy-steering committee and Singapore's finance minister, told a news conference at the end of the IMF meeting. 'We know there are near-term risks, the most obvious one being what's going on in the US with regard to the fiscal deficit.' But one of the big near-term concerns, the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will start scaling back its massive stimulus program for the economy, is actually pointing to a positive development, Tharman said. Talks: Jim Yong Kim, (left), president, World Bank Group, and Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director, talk before a meeting of the Development Committee during the World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings in Washington . It means that the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand a reduction of the stimulus. IMF officials have been forecasting that the strengthening U.S. economy will be a main driver of the global economy in the coming year. At the same time, developing country economies are slowing and their markets have been unsettled since May by anticipation that the Fed will soon begin tapering its $85-billion-a-month bond purchases, which poured cash into the economy to stimulate growth. 'The eventual normalisation of monetary policy as economies recover in the West will be a net positive for the emerging economies,' Tharman said, meaning that the strength of the major economies would help carry the global economy forward. Lew told finance ministers that the US understood the role it played as 'the anchor of the international financial system', and assured them the administration was doing all it could to reach a resolution on the debt. Stalemate: Speaker of the House John Boehner walks to his office after a meeting with fellow Republicans at the Capitol in Washington on Saturday . An effort Saturday to pass a one-year extension of the borrowing limit failed to get sufficient votes. But in a more hopeful sign, negotiations began between Democratic and Republican Senate leaders to end the impasse. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, was one of a number of officials who were guardedly confident that an eleventh-hour deal would be reached, as it has in similar standoffs in the past. 'I still think it is unthinkable that an agreement won't be found,' Draghi told reporters on Saturday. 'If this situation were to last a long time, it would be very negative for the U.S. economy and the world economy and could certainly harm the recovery.' But once Draghi moved beyond the US impasse, he sounded upbeat about the prospects for a European recovery. That in itself is a dramatic turn from the past three years, when global financial leaders were taken up with waves of crisis sweeping across the region and necessitating a series of international rescue loans. Business not as usual: President Barack Obama yesterday discussed challenges from the partial government shutdown small business owners . The IMF called on emerging economies, which have been the drivers of the global economy in recent years, to undertake reforms that will help their economies better withstand the scaling back of monetary stimulus in the U.S. and other major economies. When the stimulus money was flowing, emerging economies benefited from investments as investors were attracted by their relatively higher rates of interest vis-a-vis the United States and other major economies. But many of those same countries that benefited from capital flows have been rocked since May, as the investment flows reversed and flowed back toward the US as rates here began to rise. Alexandre Tombini, the head Brazil's central bank, told the IMF steering committee that the worries about the US and global economies might be overblown. 'A while ago there was an excess of exuberance and now perhaps an excess of pessimism,' he said. Negotiating: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada is surrounded by reporters as he leaves the Senate floor to meet with Senate Democrats regarding the government shutdown and debt ceiling . Time is ticking: Republican Senator from Kentucky Mitch McConnell walks off the Senate floor after a vote on the motion to proceed on the Debt Limit Bill . The stark warnings from the World Bank came the same day that House Speaker John Boehner today told fellow Republicans that his talks with President Barack Obama have stalled. 'The Senate needs to hold tough,' Representative Greg Walden said Boehner told House GOP lawmakers. 'The president now isn't negotiating with us.' Obama rejected the speaker's effort to lift the debt ceiling for six weeks and reopen government in exchange for a budget negotiating process. Attention now turns to the Senate, where a bipartisan group of Senators are working on a separate plan to reopen the government. New plan: Republican Senator from Maine Susan Collins leaves a Republican meeting and heads to the Senate floor to vote on the motion to proceed on the Debt Limit Bill . Word of the negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and the top Republican, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, emerged as the Senate, as expected, rejected a Democratic effort to raise the government's borrowing limit through next year. Republicans objected because they want the extension to be accompanied by spending cuts. The calendar is edging closer to the October 17 deadline to raise the federal debt ceiling. After that, administration officials have said the government will deplete its ability to borrow money, risking a first-time federal default that could jolt the world economy.",

Manchester City are the best-paid sports team in the world, with average first-team pay a whopping £5.3m a year, or £102,653 per week according to a new report that compares global earnings in the most popular leagues. Five Premier League sides make the top 20 on the list, with Liverpool - City's title showdown opponents from Sunday - in 20th place, earning an average of £3.4m per man per year. Manchester United are at No 8 on £4.3m per man per year, Champions League semi-finalists Chelsea are at No 10 (nearly £4m) and Arsenal are at No 11 (£3.9m). Scroll down to see the table of the world's highest-paid sports teams . High earners: Manchester City have topped a global sports salary list, with their squad paid £5.3m a year . Big spender: City owner Sheik Mansour has invested hundreds of millions into making them title challengers . Blank cheque: Manuel Pellegrini could sign pretty much any player in the world for City . Two giants from American baseball, the New York Yankees and the LA Dodgers, as well as the two giants of Spanish football, Real Madrid and Barcelona, fill out the top five behind City. The top 10 also includes the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA (at No 6), Bayern Munich (No 7), and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA (No 9). The Global Sports Salaries Survey (GSSS), produced for ESPN The Magazine in the USA, has been tracking comparative pay at major sports teams for five years. City players were earning an average of just under £1.5m a year each when Sheik Mansour arrived in 2008 but their pay has more than trebled in the six years of his ownership. Chelsea have also seen their wages and . fortunes soar since Roman Abramovich arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2003 . but foreign sugar-daddy ownership is not restricted to elite European . football. Big hitters: The New York Yankees baseball team ranked second on the earners' list . Coining it in: The Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team are third on the salary list with an average annual pay of £5.1m but they moved down from second place last year . The Brooklyn Nets were bought in 2010 by one of Abramovich's fellow Russian billionaires, Mikhail Prokhorov. Not only is Prokhorov footing the Nets' $102m (around £61m) total payroll in 2013-14, or £4.5m per player this year, but he will need to pay an additional $70m (around £42m) or thereabouts in luxury tax for exceeding the NBA's wage cap. On the list: Chelsea were 10th in the rankings with a £3.9m wage bill and still have a chance of winning the Premier League title this season . Wealth: Roman Abramovich has poured millions into Chelsea since he became owner in 2003 . Close call: Arsenal are just behind Chelsea in the survey. They advanced to the final of the FA Cup at the weekend, beating Wigan on penalties at Wembley . Sneaking in: Liverpool came in 20th in the salary list with an annual spend of £3.4m on wages each year. That could increase if they win their first league title in 24 years next month . Overpaid? Manchester United came in eighth in the list but have fallen short in the Premier League and Champions League this season .

      "article": "(CNN) -- Guatemala's Constitutional Court has barred the country's former first lady from running for president -- shaking up the political landscape a month before the election. The court's Monday ruling means Sandra Torres, who divorced Guatemala's current president in an attempt to circumvent a nepotism law, has now exhausted her appeals. The seven justices voted unanimously that Torres was not eligible to be on the ballot because close relatives of the president are constitutionally barred from running. Three of the judges had additional arguments for the decision. Their decision upheld a Supreme Court of Justice ruling issued last month. Torres slammed the ruling Tuesday, saying it left Guatemala's neediest citizens without anyone to represent them in the country's highest office. \"Without any legal basis, they made decisions that were political, not legal,\" she told reporters Tuesday. \"For me, it is anti-democratic, this political lynching, this lynching in the media,\" she added. Torres filed for divorce from President Alvaro Colom on March 11; the divorce was finalized in April. The country's Supreme Court ruled last month that the divorce was used to avoid the constitutional prohibition, and that in trying to get around the law, Torres committed fraud. She appealed to the Constitutional Court, which has final say in all constitutional matters. The Constitutional Court said that Torres was a close relative of the president and thus not eligible to run, but it dissented by rejecting that legal fraud had occurred. Some followers of Torres, who were gathered outside the court, cried when they heard the news. Torres said Tuesday that she had not decided whether to support another presidential candidate. She urged her followers to support congressional and mayoral candidates from the coalition of parties behind her candidacy, saying they would protect social programs. In her statement before the Constitutional Court last week, Torres accused the supreme court of having politicized justice. More than 1.7 million Guatemalans had signed a petition saying they wanted her as a candidate, she said, arguing that the people's voice should be heard. \"Democracy is built with more democracy,\" she told the judges. In her argument she reiterated that she was \"not married to anyone\" and suggested that there was discrimination against her because of her gender. Torres, 55, is a former businesswoman and clothing exporter. She was the candidate of the coalition of the National Unity for Hope Party (UNE) and the Grand National Alliance (GANA). The end to her candidacy could boost the presidential aspirations of the front-runner, retired Gen. Otto Perez Molina of the Patriotic Party. According to a Prodatos poll released in late July, 37.6% of those surveyed said they would vote for Perez Molina in the September 11 elections. Torres came in second with 17.2% of the vote. The poll also asked who they would vote for if Torres' candidacy was rejected. With Torres out, Perez Molina's numbers rose to 41.2%, and former congressman Manuel Baldizon, of the Democratic Renovated Liberty Party (Lider), was a distant second with 13.6%.",

Thousands have died. Neither the Ukrainian government, the rebels or the Russian government (under Vladimir Putin) have taken responsibility for the tragic event.

Instead of feeling like they're on the wrong side of a quarantine -- and serving decidedly lack-luster food (everyone's had a run-in with those dreaded airport \"panini\") -- these lounges are oases offering first-rate amenities, privacy and calm.

      "article": "Washington (CNN) -- Fire-protection systems on freight aircraft are inadequate, top U.S. aviation investigators say. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended improvements and rule changes Wednesday based on investigations of three catastrophic cargo plane fires. NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration require better early detection of fires inside cargo containers, development of fire-resistant containers and requiring active fire-suppression systems on all freight airlines. An NTSB report focused on three cargo fire accidents since 2006. Two of those fires killed the flight crews and destroyed the aircraft, in incidents in Dubai and North Korea. In the third incident in Philadelphia, the crew escaped with minor smoke-inhalation difficulties, and the plane was significantly damaged. \"These fires quickly grew out of control, leaving the crew with little time to get the aircraft on the ground,\" Hersman said in a statement released with the report. \"Detection, suppression and containment systems can give crews more time and more options. The current approach is not safe enough.\" FAA budget cuts would affect fliers . In all three cases, the fires started within the cargo containers aboard the planes, but by the time the plane's fire warning system alerted pilots to the dangers, there was little time for them to react. Federal regulations require cargo airline fire detection systems to alert pilots within one minute of a fire starting, but the NTSB's investigation found current systems detected fire and smoke anywhere from two and half minutes to more than 18 minutes after the fire started. The NTSB concluded cargo containers made of flammable materials significantly increase the intensity of the on-board fires because there's been little focus by manufacturers or regulators to develop fire-resistant cargo containers. Additionally, the NTSB's report recommended improved fire suppression systems on cargo planes, a recommendation it originally made to the FAA in 2007. After the 2007 recommendation, the FAA did a cost-benefit analysis of upgrading fire suppression systems and found it to be too expensive, a fact the NTSB highlighted in its report. \"The two catastrophic cargo airplane fires that occurred in less than a year occurred after the FAA's cost-benefit analysis concluded that the installation of fire suppression systems was not cost-effective,\" the board said. UPS briefed Hersman earlier this week on the shipping company's efforts to develop improved fire safety standards. Also, FedEx is in the process of installing a fire suppression system on its long-haul fleet, the NTSB said. In an e-mail statement to CNN, FAA officials said the agency \"has long supported improved fire protection on all cargo airplanes through research on new, non-Halon fire extinguishing agents, fire suppression systems directed at individual cargo containers or specific cargo compartment zones, and advanced cargo containers incorporating smoke detection, fire containment, and/or fire suppression systems.\" FAA officials said they would carefully evaluate the NTSB's recommendations.

Mr Berlin, 33, asked 50 artists to paint a picture of his son Jacob (above) and was pleased that 23 responded . Mr Berlin filmed his wife's reaction to the works - created by a range of artists - and posted the video online . Baby Bond: The images came in over a period months - and Mr Berlin liked them all, so he hung them all up . To his surprise, 23 artists replied. Ernst, whose nine-month-old son Jacob would also feature in the pictures, said he liked all of their works so much he couldn't turn them down. As an amateur photographer, Ernst, 33, decided to send the artists a selection of 40 pictures of his family, allowing them to choose which they would like to work with. Over a period of a few months, the images kept coming in. When her birthday came around, Ernst treated Agnes, now 34, to a three-hour-long spa treatment - allowing him to hang the works on the wall while she was out. Agnes' reaction was one of shock, with Ernst filming her response and later putting it on YouTube for friends and family to see. Mr Berlin, an amateur photographer, found the artists on website Reddit, and after initially asking the group if anyone was interested, was surprised when submissions kept coming in over a period of several months . Mr Berlin's nine-month-old son Jacob became the star of the show - and featured in the majority of the pieces . The artists chose from 40 pictures altogether, such as this cute image of Jacob resting on his mother's belly . After receiving the final artworks back from the artists, Mr Berlin hung them around the house for his wife . Mr Berlin, 33, said: 'I was worried about not finishing it in time, but luckily it all worked out' One of the artists chose to recreate this picture of Agnes and Jacob in hospital just after he was born . Mr Berlin sent a selection of adorable pictures to the artists, including this one of nine-month-old Jacob . He then waited over a period of several months for the artists' own creations to be returned to him . Jacob features in the majority of the artworks, which were given to his surprised mother on her birthday . Mr Berlin said the response to his idea from his family and friends has been overwhelmingly positive . The idea to approach the artists was a 'light bulb moment', according to Mr Berlin. Pictured: A photograph of young Jacob (left) and a replica artwork supplied by one of the artists which Mr Berlin found on Reddit . Mr Berlin, his wife Agnes and their son Jacob could be seen having fun in a park in one of the photographs . The same photograph was transformed by one of the artists on Reddit (above) and returned to the family . Ernst, from Chicago, Illinois, said: 'I completely forgot about Reddit until I sat down and started brainstorming ideas for a gift. 'A light bulb went off and I remembered the community of artists. 'I gathered a group of around 45 to 50 artists and got in contact with them to commission the work. '23 replied - which was more than I expected - but I loved all their previous work so much that I couldn't say no to any of them. 'Honestly, I was worried about not finishing it in time, but luckily it all worked out. 'The response has been overwhelmingly positive from friends and family.'",

Apple has been portrayed as a corporate bully that allegedly lead an illegal scheme to raise the prices of e-books, in a civic trial today. The Justice Department's suit claims that the Silicon Valley giant forced an end to price . competition and costing consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. Justice Department attorney, Lawrence Buterman, said a dramatic price increase in e-books was 'no accident or unforeseen outcome' but the result of a deliberate plan by Apple and five book publishers to eliminate Amazon's $9.99 bargain price for popular e-books. He asked U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who is overseeing a trial expected to last several weeks, to find that the computer company had violated anti-trust laws.

      "article": "The Obama administration is . considering imposing a forced quarantine on healthcare workers who return to the . United States from the Ebola hot zone of West Africa, after a . New York doctor who treated patients there tested positive . for the virus on Thursday. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention spokesman Tom Skinner told Reuters on Friday that a mandatory quarantine is one possible plan under discussion by officials from . across the administration. 'There are a number of options being discussed pertaining to . the monitoring and mobility of healthcare workers who are . returning to the United States from affected countries,' Skinner . said. Jeff Hulbert of Annapolis, Maryland, held up a sign in front of the White House on Friday; he wants a mandatory quarantine for all people – not just doctors – who have returned to the US from Ebola-ravaged countries . President Barack Obama meets with Ebola survivor Nina Pham (right) in the Oval Office on Friday, as the CDC scrambled to upgrade its plan to contain the virus before exposed people can spread it in the US . 'We want to strike the right balance of doing what is best . to protect the public's health while not impeding whatsoever our . ability to combat the epidemic in West Africa. Our risk here . will not be zero until we stop the epidemic there.' As for a possible quarantine, 'that's one of the options on the table,' Skinner said. The CDC-led discussions began on Thursday after Dr. Craig . Spencer in New York became the fourth person diagnosed with the . disease in the United States. Skinner said discussions are likely to produce some change . in current policy and that the aim is to reach a decision as . soon as possible. The Spencer case has heightened public anxiety about the . virus and the Obama administration's response to its arrival on . U.S. soil. Last month, Liberian national Thomas Eric Duncan became the . first case diagnosed in the United States after arriving in . Dallas from his home country. He died on Oct. 8. Two nurses who helped treat him came down with Ebola, . stirring fear about infection dangers and uncertainty about U.S. preparedness for dealing with the virus.

      "article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A pressurized cylinder exploded at Universal Studios on Sunday, injuring two firefighters as they tried to fight a blaze that began earlier in the day, Los Angeles authorities said. The fire destroyed buildings and movie sets at Universal Studios on Sunday. Eight other firefighters were injured in the fire, which was expected to be contained by 4:15 p.m. (7:15 p.m. ET), said Ron Haralson, an inspector with the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The explosion occurred about 2:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. ET) near the video vault of the Universal Studios back lot. The vault was damaged. The fast-moving, early morning blaze destroyed several movie sets and the King Kong exhibit. Even so, officials still planned to go ahead with the 2008 MTV Movie Awards show at the site -- just north of downtown Los Angeles, adjacent to the Universal Studios theme park. \"The areas we are utilizing for our production were unaffected and the 2008 MTV Movie Awards will go on as planned. We're working closely with authorities to make sure everything operates smoothly,\" an MTV spokesman said in a statement. The awards show will bring a parade of A-list stars to the park's CityWalk area. According to MTV's Web site, celebrities such as Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Sarah Jessica Parker, Justin Timberlake and Robert Downey Jr. likely will attend. Universal Studios officials planned to resume normal business hours Monday, including the studio tour. The fire destroyed an area called New York street, which includes movie set-style buildings designed to look like the cityscape of New York City. Hours after the blaze was reported, the roughly two-block area appeared charred and resembled a \"disaster movie,\" said Los Angeles Councilman Tom LaBonge. LaBonge said he could see the smoke from his Silver Lake home Sunday morning. \"It looked like a bomb had exploded,\" he said. Watch choppers try to douse the fire  . The blaze began around 4:45 a.m. (7:45 a.m. ET) and was contained initially by 9 a.m. Throughout the morning, large plumes of black smoke rose as the fire burned the vault containing hundreds of videos, said Ron Meyer, chief operating officer of Universal Studios. \"Fortunately, nothing irreplaceable was lost,\" Meyer said. \"The video library was affected and damaged, but our main vault of our motion picture negatives was not.\" The set of \"The Changeling,\" a film recently directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Angelina Jolie, was \"completely destroyed,\" Meyer said.

      "article": "Police chiefs have handed Leeds United more than £1.2 million after the High Court ruled that the Championship football club had been overcharged for policing at home games, a judge has heard. But Leeds' bosses claim that they are still owed more than £800,000, Sir David Eady was told. The figures emerged on Friday after the judge examined the latest stage of the dispute between West Yorkshire Police and Leeds. Overharged: West Yorkshire Police have been ordered to pay Leeds £1.2m . Two years ago Eady ruled that the force overcharged for 'special police services' over three seasons between 2009 and 2012, following a High Court hearing. West Yorkshire Police and Leeds are now arguing over how exactly much should be repaid. The judge on Friday revealed detail of developments in the case in a written analysis following a further High Court hearing in London in June. 'In July 2012, I ruled that Leeds United Football Club had been charged for special police services over the three preceding football seasons, in respect of home matches, on a basis that was in part unlawful,' Eady said. 'It thus became necessary to find a methodology by which to calculate the appropriate rebate. It did not prove possible for the parties to agree a formula. Each ... proposed a distinct methodology.' Dispute: Leeds United and West Yorkshire Police have been in court over fees for services . The judge said one area of dispute related to how special police service charges should be made for the 2012-13 seasons and 2013-14 seasons. 'West Yorkshire Police has paid Leeds United Football Club £1,238,816.61 which is said to represent the total loss including interest,' he added. 'Leeds United Football Club, on the other hand, seeks a further £844,016.36 plus interest (to include claims in respect of 2012-13 and 2013-14).' The judge said the force had 'repaid the rebate it thought due' and 'claims now that no more is owed'. Eady said a 'particular problem' related to the policing of areas of land near the entrance to Elland Road - where a statue of former Leeds captain Billy Bremner was sited. Boost: Leeds ownere Massimo Cellino (centre) knows the club are under financial difficulty . The judge said that, because of crowd movement, there was no 'definitive method' of identifying how many officers were needed in each area. He said the only practical solution was to attribute a 'fair and reasonable proportion' to each area. He said Leeds wanted a 'detailed breakdown' of how many officers were deployed on each match day and at 'what rate of remuneration'. But he said that would go beyond what was reasonable and impose unnecessary burdens upon police bosses. The original litigation had centred on the policing of land near the ground not owned, leased or controlled by Leeds. Eady had ruled that the services rendered fell within the normal police duty to keep the peace.",

The judge said one area of dispute related to how special police service charges should be made for the 2012-13 seasons and 2013-14 seasons. 'West Yorkshire Police has paid Leeds United Football Club £1,238,816.61 which is said to represent the total loss including interest,' he added. 'Leeds United Football Club, on the other hand, seeks a further £844,016.36 plus interest (to include claims in respect of 2012-13 and 2013-14).' The judge said the force had 'repaid the rebate it thought due' and 'claims now that no more is owed'. Eady said a 'particular problem' related to the policing of areas of land near the entrance to Elland Road - where a statue of former Leeds captain Billy Bremner was sited. Boost: Leeds ownere Massimo Cellino (centre) knows the club are under financial difficulty . The judge said that, because of crowd movement, there was no 'definitive method' of identifying how many officers were needed in each area. He said the only practical solution was to attribute a 'fair and reasonable proportion' to each area. He said Leeds wanted a 'detailed breakdown' of how many officers were deployed on each match day and at 'what rate of remuneration'. But he said that would go beyond what was reasonable and impose unnecessary burdens upon police bosses. The original litigation had centred on the policing of land near the ground not owned, leased or controlled by Leeds. Eady had ruled that the services rendered fell within the normal police duty to keep the peace.\nSummary:\n",

The Republican camp's sharp response came after Biden said GOP advocates for children with birth defects should support stem cell research. During a campaign event in Columbia, Missouri, Biden did not mention his Republican counterpart by name but said, \"I hear all this talk about how the Republicans are going to work in dealing with parents who have both the joy ... and the difficulty of raising a child who has a developmental disability, who were born with a birth defect.\" Biden's support of stem cell research is at odds with the position taken by the Republicans' vice presidential nominee, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, whose 5-month-old son, Trig, has Down syndrome. Palin, an evangelical Christian, opposes stem cell research because it involves the use of human embryos, but her running mate, GOP presidential nominee McCain, does support stem cell research. \"Well, guess what, folks? If you care about it, why don't you support stem cell research?\" asked Biden, the running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Sen. Barack Obama. Those comments brought a sharp response. \"Barack Obama's running mate sunk to a new low today, launching an offensive debate over who cares more about special needs children,\" McCain-Palin spokesman Ben Porritt said. \"Playing politics with this issue is disturbing and indicative of a desperate campaign.\" Biden spokesman David Wade insisted that the Delaware senator's comments were not directed at Palin. \"This is a clash of policies, not a clash of personalities,\" Wade said. \"We've heard not a dime's worth of difference between the McCain-Palin ticket and the Bush administration on medical breakthroughs that millions of parents and doctors believe could save lives and transform the quality of life for countless Americans.\" During her acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention last week, Palin told parents of children with disabilities that she would be \"a friend and advocate in the White House.\" But the Alaska governor's support for the disabled has come under scrutiny since McCain chose Palin to be his running mate nearly two weeks ago.

      "article": "A charge of making a false bomb threat has been dropped against a man who carried a backpack containing a rice cooker near a crowd marking the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings in April, prosecutors said Wednesday. Investigators dropped the charge because they say the suspect, Kevin Edson, 25, did not communicate an \"overt threat that an incendiary device would be detonated,\" Jake Wark, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney, told CNN. Edson was arrested after carrying the backpack with a rice cooker near the finish line on Boylston Street in Boston while survivors of the 2013 bombing were commemorating its anniversary on April 15. In the 2013 attack, two pressure-cooker bombs exploded, killing three people and wounding at least 264 others. A barefoot Edson, carrying a backpack and wearing black clothes with a veil and hat covering his face, screamed and yelled near the end of the anniversary event on Boylston Street, drawing officers' attention, police said. Wark said prosecutors decided to drop the charge after reviewing statements Edson made at the scene as well as video shot by onlookers. Edson still faces charges of disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, disturbing a public assembly and possession or use of a hoax device. His next court date is scheduled for August 27. The charge of making a false bomb threat carried the most severe sentence upon conviction -- up to 20 years in prison. Possession or use of a hoax device carries a maximum sentence of five years, Wark said. A judge in April set bail at $100,000 for Edson. The judge also ordered Edson, also known as Kayvon Edson, to be seen at a state hospital that evaluates defendants' sanity after a mental health professional told the judge that Edson has a history of psychiatric disturbances.

      "article": "COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- The United States faces a Zimbabwe-style economic collapse if it keeps \"spending a bunch of money we don't have,\" South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford said Wednesday. South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford says he does not want to spend money that his state doesn't have. Sanford, a Republican, has been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration's $800 billion stimulus plan. He said he'll turn down about a quarter of his state's $2.8 billion share unless Washington lets him use that money to pay down debt. \"What you're doing is buying into the notion that if we just print some more money that we don't have and send it to different states, we'll create jobs,\" he said. \"If that's the case, why isn't Zimbabwe a rich place?\" Zimbabwe has been in the throes of an economic meltdown ever since the southern African nation embarked on a chaotic land reform program. Its official inflation rate topped 11 million percent in 2008, with its treasury printing banknotes in the trillion-dollar range to keep up with the plummeting value of its currency. But with South Carolina's unemployment rate now the second-highest in the country, state lawmakers will attempt to override Sanford and take the $700 million if he turns it down, Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer said. \"They will use the total economic stimulus to stimulate the economy, jump-start it, so we can get out of the ditch we are in as a state and as a nation,\" Bauer, a fellow Republican, said in a written statement Wednesday. Labor Department figures released Wednesday showed South Carolina's January unemployment rate hit 10.4 percent, second only to Michigan's 11.6 percent. Sanford is one of several Republican governors who have criticized the nearly $800 billion stimulus package, which passed with minimal GOP support in the Senate and none in the House of Representatives. Other governors, such as California Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger or Michigan Democrat Jennifer Granholm, have said they would take any money Republican-led states reject. But Sanford told reporters that taking the money now would leave the state in the lurch in two years, \"when those funds dry up.\" \"Fundamentally, if you boil down what the stimulus means for South Carolina, it means we would go through the process of spending a bunch of money we don't have,\" he said. The stimulus measure allows state legislatures to override governors and take the money -- a provision championed by South Carolina congressman James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House. Clyburn said Sanford is unlikely to get any waiver from the administration, and he called the governor's announcement \"100 percent political posturing.\" \"This recovery package is designed to stabilize communities, to save and create jobs, and help our economy get back in a growth mode,\" he told reporters. \"And you don't do that by paying down debt that's been incurred over a long period of time.\" And Bauer said that if South Carolina turns down the money, \"South Carolina taxpayers will be taking on the debt for economic stimulus money sent elsewhere.\" Sanford has been called a potential GOP presidential contender in 2012, but he told CNN that the next election is \"not where I'm focused.\" \"I don't rule anything in, I don't rule anything out,\" he said, adding, \"If anything came along like that, it would be an incredibly long shot.\"",

      "article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nearly 6.2 million students in the United States between the ages of 16 and 24 in 2007 dropped out of high school, fueling what a report released Tuesday called \"a persistent high school dropout crisis.\" A new report on high school dropouts in the United States calls for a national re-enrollment strategy. The total represents 16 percent of all people in the United States in that age range in 2007. Most of the dropouts were Latino or black, according to a report by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, and the Alternative Schools Network in Chicago, Illinois. \"Because of the widespread, pressing nature of the crisis and the large numbers of young people who have already dropped out, a national re-enrollment strategy should be a fundamental part of America's national education agenda,\" the report says. However, the report notes, the \"absence of new funding at the federal and state level since the 1980s has led to decades of disinvestment in re-enrollment programs across the country.\" Despite the funding cutbacks, there have been re-enrollment successes nationally and in a number of cities including Chicago; Los Angeles, California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Portland, Oregon, the report says. \"These programs have found that young people who have left high school before earning a diploma are not dead-end dropouts, but often are in fact students waiting and looking for opportunities to re-enroll and finish high school,\" the study says. \"The most successful programs are small (80-150 students), offering comprehensive after-school and summer activities, led by experienced principals and teachers, focused on learning in the real world, well-funded with local school site program and fiscal control, and track specific, measurable outcomes for student achievement including skill gains, enrollment, attendance, credit gains, promotions and graduations.\" Jesse Williams, 22, was one of those dropouts who is now working on her degree. She said a street shooting in which one friend died and two were wounded was the start of her losing interest in school. \"My junior year I dropped out,\" she said at a summit in Washington on Tuesday. \"Too much gang violence, teachers discriminating because of the color of my skin, or where I come from.\" Now re-enrolled in a Chicago school dedicated to bringing dropouts back to education, Williams said, \"They help me in my classwork. I have a mentor that checks up on me monthly. She goes to my house, sees if there's anything that I need.\" Researchers for the study analyzed the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Surveys, household data from the Current Population Survey, national data on GED certificate awards and other official sources to examine the problem at the national level and in the nation's 12 largest states: California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia. Men and blacks and Hispanics of both genders are among those particularly prone to dropping out of high school. \"As these data show, this dropout crisis is disproportionately affecting America's communities of color,\" said Marc Morial, president and chief executive officer of the National Urban League. \"Youth from all communities deserve an equal chance at educational success.\" Among the findings in the report, \"Left Behind in America: The Nation's Dropout Crisis:\" The dropout situation at the state level was similarly widespread: .

Over a working lifetime from ages 18-64, high school dropouts are estimated to earn $400,000 less than those that graduated from high school. For males, the lifetime earnings loss is nearly $485,000 and exceeds $500,000 in many large states.

A top independent school in Scotland is offering parents a mortgage-style payment scheme for their child's school fees. In a move to make private education more affordable, the Fernhill School in Glasgow has offered parents the chance to spread the cost of fees over ten years, interest free. Tony Boswell, a governor of the Catholic school, which charges £8976 a year for a senior school day pupil, said the new payment plan, thought to be the first of its kind in Scotland, could reduce monthly payments by up to 50 per cent. 'Innovative': Under the Fernhill scheme, parents can pay half the school fees every year and repay the outstanding amount after their child has left . He said: ‚öÑ≤We recognise that times are tough and we have been striving to develop a solution that helps families who may otherwise be unable to afford an independent education. ‚öÑ≤Fernhill's payment plan will be launched for the 2013/14 school year and allow parents whose children are joining this year to spread the cost of their fees over a longer term. ‚öÑ≤There is high demand from prospective parents for this kind of payment plan and, as this recession lengthens, we believe it is the right thing to do to ease the financial burden on those who want a private education.' The average cost of private education is now more than £12,000 a year, with fees rising faster than the rate of inflation. Money troubles: The increase in school fees has put pressure on parents . The price of sending a child to an independent school in Scotland rose by 3.5 per cent in 2012/13 - with the highest fees topping £21,000. The increases put pressure on parents - particularly those for whom private education is at the limits of affordability. In February, the consumer price index, the Government's preferred measure of inflation, was running at 2.7 per cent, while the retail price index rose to 3.3 per cent in January. A report by the Bank of Scotland - published before the impact of the credit crunch - warned that members of key Scottish professions were already being priced out of sending their children to fee-paying schools, with teachers, engineers and police officers no longer able to afford a private education. More recently, the number of children attending private school in Scotland has fallen, with a drop of 1.5 per cent in both nursery and primary between 2010/11 and 2011/12. Under the Fernhill scheme, parents can pay half the school fees every year rather than the full amount and continue to repay the outstanding sums once their child has left. Other financial schemes available to parents in the sector include savings plans where money can be built up in advance of paying fees. In England, a number of finance companies offer to pay the fees in advance with parents repaying over a longer period time plus additional interest. A spokeswoman for the Scottish Council for Independent Schools described the scheme as ‚öÑ≤innovative'.

Little more than half of British children still live with both their birth parents by the time they are 15, according to shocking statistics on the breakdown of family life. Eight out ten babies are born to couples living together, but that figure falls to just 55 per cent as they grow up. The figures were released as Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith announced plans to pay private firms and charities to help keep Britain's 120,000 problem families together. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith today released figures showing how the percentage of children still living with both birth parents falls as children grew up. Source: Understanding Society, 2009-2010 . He said the Government would change the way it measures the success of social programmes for the poor, to make preventing the breakdown of family life the key yardstick. Rather than simply recording how much money is thrown at the schemes, officials will have to log how they promote family stability, combat worklessness and whether children in the families affected perform as well their peers in other families. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith used a speech today to say the government would intervene to stop parents splitting up . Companies will then be paid according to whether they improve those statistics in the 120,000 families identified as the cause of most anti-social behaviour in Britain. Calling family ‚öÑ≤the most important building block in a child's life', Mr Duncan Smith made clear the Government will prioritise keeping families together. In a speech yesterday at a Social Justice Conference in London, he said: ‚öÑ≤Stable, loving families matter. They matter for this government, and they matter for the most vulnerable in society. ‚öÑ≤By measuring the proportion of children living with the same parents from birth and whether their parents report a good quality relationship we are driving home the message that social programmes should promote family stability and avert breakdown.' He added: ‚öÑ≤You don't help families by shrugging your shoulders when parental relationships fall apart. ‚öÑ≤When families are strong and stable, so are children – showing higher levels of wellbeing and more positive outcomes. But when things go wrong – either through family breakdown or a damaged parental relationship – the impact on a child's later life can be devastating.' The Government will also measure whether children from disadvantaged backgrounds do as well at school as other pupils and the percentage of young people who fall ‚öÑ≤into a pattern of offending'. A survey of offenders found 41 per cent had witnessed violence in their home as a child. Other measures of success will focus on outcomes for those in treatment for addiction, and re-offending rates for those who have committed crime, recognising that such problems are often linked and overlapping. The proportion of benefit claimants who are able to work, but have been on out-of-work benefits for three out of the last four years will also be recorded to allow the Government to ‚öÑ≤concentrate efforts on reaching those for whom worklessness has become a way of life', Mr Duncan Smith said. Figures released by the DWP yesterday show that of those currently on out-of-work benefits, 59 per cent, or around 2.5million individuals, have been claiming for at least 75 per cent of the four-year period. That means 2.5million have been on benefits for three out of the last four years. Hailing the payment by results scheme, Mr Duncan Smith said: ‚öÑ≤Because we are paying by results, we will only pay for what works - reducing the risk on the taxpayer and ensuring that every pound of Government money is only being spent where it has a positive impact on people's lives.'",

Those are the questions bloggers and Twitter users are batting around the Internet on Monday following a news report saying Facebook is looking into ways it could let kids under the age of 13 use the site with parental consent. Currently, Facebook bans children younger than 13. Data from Microsoft Research and Consumer Reports, however, show that many kids use the site anyway, often with their parents' knowledge. A 2011 Consumer Reports survey found 7.5 million people younger than 13 use the site; nearly a third of 11-year-olds and more than half of 12-year-olds use Facebook with their parents' knowledge, according to a 1,007-person survey supported by Microsoft Research. Proponents of lifting Facebook's under-13 ban say letting young kids on Facebook with the help of adults would allow them to use the social network more safely. \"Whether we like it or not, millions of children are using Facebook, and since there doesn't seem to be a universally effective way to get them off the service, the best and safest strategy would be to provide younger children with a safe, secure and private experience that allows them to interact with verified friends and family members without having to lie about their age,\" Larry Magid writes at Forbes.com.

What a boob: A handout picture released by the Spanish National Police shows the two breast implants containing £70,000 worth of cocaine hidden in breasts of a woman arrested at Madrid's airport . The woman had just arrived on a flight from Bogota, Colombia, and officers took her to one side due to her behaviour as she went through customs at Madrid airport. Although nothing was found in her luggage, customs officials ordered a full body search. A frisk by female officers revealed irregularities and deformations in both of the suspect's breasts. The passenger then 'became nervous and confessed to carrying cocaine implants,' a police statement said Friday.

      "article": "A massive underground ocean on Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is as salty as the Earth's Dead Sea, it has been revealed. Nasa scientists analyzing data from the Cassini mission say the have firm evidence the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts. They say the density of the oceans mean they are are salty as the Dead Sea. Researchers found that Titan's ice shell, which overlies a very salty ocean, varies in thickness around the moon, suggesting the crust is in the process of becoming rigid. Nasa scientists analyzing data from the Cassini mission say the have firm evidence the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts. Using the Cassini data, researchers presented a model structure for Titan, resulting in an improved understanding of the structure of the moon's outer ice shell. Researchers found that a relatively high density was required for Titan's ocean in order to explain the gravity data. This indicates the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts likely composed of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The density indicated for this brine would give the ocean a salt content roughly equal to the saltiest bodies of water on Earth. It is believed the ocean is made of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The new results come from a study of gravity and topography data collected during Cassini's repeated flybys of Titan during the past 10 years. Using the Cassini data, researchers presented a model structure for Titan, resulting in an improved understanding of the structure of the moon's outer ice shell. The findings are published in this week's edition of the journal Icarus. 'Titan continues to prove itself as an endlessly fascinating world, and with our long-lived Cassini spacecraft, we're unlocking new mysteries as fast as we solve old ones,' said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was not involved in the study. The salt content allows the bathers to read while floating effortlessly in the Dead Sea, Jordan Valley. Experts say the underground ocean on Titan would be similar. Additional findings support previous indications the moon's icy shell is rigid and in the process of freezing solid. Researchers found that a relatively high density was required for Titan's ocean in order to explain the gravity data. This indicates the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts likely composed of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The density indicated for this brine would give the ocean a salt content roughly equal to the saltiest bodies of water on Earth. 'This is an extremely salty ocean by Earth standards,' said the paper's lead author, Giuseppe Mitri of the University of Nantes in France. 'Knowing this may change the way we view this ocean as a possible abode for present-day life, but conditions might have been very different there in the past.' Cassini data also indicate the thickness of Titan's ice crust varies slightly from place to place. The researchers said this can best be explained if the moon's outer shell is stiff, as would be the case if the ocean were slowly crystalizing, and turning to ice. This image provided by NASA is a recent photo from the Cassini spacecraft showing planet Saturn, and if you look very closely between its wing-like rings, upper left, reveals a faint pinprick of light. That tiny dot is Earth. Otherwise, the moon's shape would tend to even itself out over time, like warm candle wax. This freezing process would have important implications for the habitability of Titan's ocean, as it would limit the ability of materials to exchange between the surface and the ocean. A further consequence of a rigid ice shell, according to the study, is any outgassing of methane into Titan's atmosphere must happen at scattered 'hot spots' -- like the hot spot on Earth that gave rise to the Hawaiian Island chain.",

This indicates the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts likely composed of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The density indicated for this brine would give the ocean a salt content roughly equal to the saltiest bodies of water on Earth. It is believed the ocean is made of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The new results come from a study of gravity and topography data collected during Cassini's repeated flybys of Titan during the past 10 years. Using the Cassini data, researchers presented a model structure for Titan, resulting in an improved understanding of the structure of the moon's outer ice shell. The findings are published in this week's edition of the journal Icarus. 'Titan continues to prove itself as an endlessly fascinating world, and with our long-lived Cassini spacecraft, we're unlocking new mysteries as fast as we solve old ones,' said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was not involved in the study. The salt content allows the bathers to read while floating effortlessly in the Dead Sea, Jordan Valley. Experts say the underground ocean on Titan would be similar. Additional findings support previous indications the moon's icy shell is rigid and in the process of freezing solid. Researchers found that a relatively high density was required for Titan's ocean in order to explain the gravity data. This indicates the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts likely composed of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The density indicated for this brine would give the ocean a salt content roughly equal to the saltiest bodies of water on Earth. 'This is an extremely salty ocean by Earth standards,' said the paper's lead author, Giuseppe Mitri of the University of Nantes in France. 'Knowing this may change the way we view this ocean as a possible abode for present-day life, but conditions might have been very different there in the past.' Cassini data also indicate the thickness of Titan's ice crust varies slightly from place to place. The researchers said this can best be explained if the moon's outer shell is stiff, as would be the case if the ocean were slowly crystalizing, and turning to ice. This image provided by NASA is a recent photo from the Cassini spacecraft showing planet Saturn, and if you look very closely between its wing-like rings, upper left, reveals a faint pinprick of light. That tiny dot is Earth. Otherwise, the moon's shape would tend to even itself out over time, like warm candle wax. This freezing process would have important implications for the habitability of Titan's ocean, as it would limit the ability of materials to exchange between the surface and the ocean. A further consequence of a rigid ice shell, according to the study, is any outgassing of methane into Titan's atmosphere must happen at scattered 'hot spots' -- like the hot spot on Earth that gave rise to the Hawaiian Island chain.\nSummary:\n",

Portillo, who was extradited to the United States last week, has always denied the charges against him and says the accusations are based on the lies of political enemies. \"This is a case of clear overreaching by the Department of Justice and the United States government against former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo, who is innocent of all the charges against him,\" defense attorney David M. Rosenfield told reporters on Tuesday. \"Former President Portillo was tried on many of these same charges in a politically motivated criminal case in Guatemala in early 2011, and was acquitted on all charges. The acquittal was upheld on appeal,\" he said. \"Former President Portillo intends to vigorously defend himself against the current charges against him and fully expects to be acquitted here just as he was acquitted in Guatemala.\" U.S. prosecutors have said Portillo, who led the Central American country from 2000 to 2004, used his authority to launder and misappropriate millions of dollars. \"Portillo is charged with converting the office of the Guatemalan presidency into his personal ATM,\" Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, said in a 2010 statement. \"Through various alleged embezzlement schemes, including one which involved $1.5 million intended for Guatemalan school children, Portillo abused the trust of his nation's people.\" An indictment unsealed in New York federal court accuses Portillo of embezzling tens of millions of dollars worth of public funds, \"a substantial portion of which he laundered through American and European bank accounts.\" After the United States made an extradition request, Guatemalan authorities arrested him on a farm on the country's coast in 2010. Guatemalan courts and the country's president authorized his extradition to the United States in 2011, but the transfer did not happen until Friday. In court Tuesday, Portillo wore a gray suit and a maroon tie. He had a pair of headphones for translation. His attorneys have asked for a bail hearing within two weeks. Portillo has said that he never laundered money in U.S. banks. \"In the United States, it is a revenge of the richest group of the American right,\" he said in an interview with CNN en Espa‚àöâ±ol in January. \"They are charging me for being the only president who did not support, with his signature nor with his permission, the invasion in Iraq.\" \"If deposits were made,\" he said, \"they are deposits that first of all come from institutions that are not illicit.

      "article": "(CNN) -- As thousands of aviation geeks, (oops, sorry, \"enthusiasts\"), hang out at this week's giant AirVenture airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the folks at Disney brought a gift: a sneak preview Friday night of the movie \"Planes.\" This is Hollywood's answer to the wildly successful animated film \"Cars.\" \"Planes\" aims to celebrate the same passion for travel across skyways that \"Cars\" did for highways. Obviously, it's a safe bet many avgeeks will like it -- it's about planes! But are they gonna respect it? Although aviation enthusiasts tend to appreciate authenticity, attention to detail and accuracy, let's remind ourselves that this is a fantasy movie about planes that talk. With that in mind, when it comes to the aircraft, does the movie bear any resemblance to reality? Well, yes, according to Sean Bautista, a veteran pilot who consulted on the film. Bautista, who has flown planes ranging from small Cessnas to fighter jets to Boeing 747 airliners, spoke with CNN from his home in California's central San Joaquin Valley about his work on \"Planes,\" and he pulled back the curtain to reveal a few behind-the-scenes details. CNN: What does this film offer adult aviation enthusiasts? What can they look forward to? Sean Bautista: At a screening for aviation enthusiasts I went to, the general comments were that, in the air, it was probably the most accurate aviation movie they've seen. That includes animated and non-animated movies. But as you watch the movie after a while, I forgot they were airplanes. You get so into the story. Of course, it's not completely realistic. One thing they did with the movie that's really unique: On the ground, the airplanes are characters. ... But in the air, with John Lasseter executive producing and Klay Hall directing -- they really pushed for accuracy. These have to be airplanes. They have to fly like airplanes. They have to move like airplanes. We can't have them go faster than they would in real life compared to other airplanes. So they really did a good job of holding true to the aviation world. They really did go to great pains -- even down to the dialogue, the radio transmissions and everything -- to keep it as accurate as they could. CNN: Spill the beans: What inaccuracies did you notice? And what did the filmmakers change because of your comments? Bautista: Early on (in the production), I was spending hours watching reels. I would have page after page of comments. I looked at everything, from toys to artwork to script to story to dialogue, everything. I would (point out things that were inaccurate), and it would start affecting the story. And when that happens, everybody including Klay Hall and the writers gets involved in it. For example, Dusty is a crop duster who dreams about being a racer. The problem is: A crop duster is slow by design. So Dusty is physically limited, and he's going to be racing against planes that can go four times his speed. So how do you get around that? It was challenging. I'd say, 'Well, first you've got to get rid of the spray boom on the bottom (of the plane).' There's so much drag from that. In the movie, they treated that almost like a vasectomy. He doesn't want to lose valuable body parts. And I thought that was a pretty hilarious way that they did it. He needed to reduce drag, increase power -- and I don't want to give away too much -- but there was a lot they had to work around. At one point (the filmmakers said), 'OK, (Dusty's) racing an airliner ... to train himself.' And I'm like, 'That particular airliner he will never, ever, ever be able to catch. You need to change that airliner to a commuter turbo prop pulling in the opposite direction so it's eating headwinds ... Mostly, my inputs came in the military flying and the airliner stuff. And then looking at controls and things. I remember there's a scene where a big race starts, and they're starting their engines, and I had them freeze it, and I watched it back again. I told them that Chu -- one of the main characters -- his propeller is turning backwards. They said, \"What do you mean it's turning backwards?\" I said, \"Well, either his engine is rotating in the wrong direction, or his propeller -- the way it's built on him right now, he will go backwards.\" And then they had me look, start looking at all the airplanes. And sure enough, I said \"that one would spin circles, because one engine was spinning backwards; one was spinning forwards.\" Things like that. They didn't know or understand the relationship between rotation direction and pitch of the propeller. So there are things in the story that were driven by input that I made, where things like that got changed. As an aviation geek, you're going to find very little wrong with this movie. CNN: What actual aircraft are represented in this movie? Or are these characters just amalgamations of planes that might look familiar to us but are not actual aircraft that we might see in real life? Bautista: Some of them are amalgamations. Dusty is an amalgamation of three different types of crop dusters. Some of them are very close to the real thing. Skipper is an F4U Corsair. There are P-51 Mustangs in the movie. But a lot of the planes, especially the more modern airplanes like airliners and things like that, are what I call \"esque.\" They're very 747-esque. Or Airbus A380-esque. The Navy airplanes are very F-18-esque, but they're not F-18s. They're close enough that any aviation enthusiast would recognize them right away. But I think for proprietary reasons, the characters had to be somewhat different. CNN: Do any of the movie characters in \"Planes\" remind you of yourself? Bautista: There are a few characters who have some of my call signs from the military days. Sparky and Dusty are some of my old fighter pilot call signs. But I kind of relate to all the characters. I really like Skipper because he's an old warrior -- an old fighter plane guy from World War ll. He carries a lot in the soul of his character and in his voice. I can relate to that because of some of the unseen, unknown events in his life in the past that affect who he is. Why is he quiet? Why is he kind of a shut-in? I can relate to Dusty and his energy and wanting to go beyond his limitations. I love the fighter characters Bravo and Echo that intercept Dusty. The military sequence was the most fun to work on. CNN: Tell us about your aviation background. Apparently, the filmmakers found someone who knows how to fly a lot of different kinds of aircraft. Bautista: I'm 55. My dad flew bombers in England and France during World War II and finished his career in Strategic Air Command. My brothers and I were all fascinated by airplanes; we grew up near a military base. My younger brother and I both had our pilot's licenses by the time we turned 17, which was the youngest age to get your pilot's license. I flew anything I could get my hands on. In college, I started flying commercially, hauling boxes for FedEx back when nobody knew who they were. I flew old radial engines, twin-engine aircraft called Beech 18 taildraggers. I ended up flying every single-engine Cessna, Piper and Beechcraft built and most of the light twins that they built, like the Cessna 310, 320, 340, 414, Beechcraft Barons, Piper Navajos. Then I wanted to know if I had what it took to be a fighter pilot. I was fortunate enough to get Air Force pilot training through the Air National Guard. I flew F-4 Phantoms and F-16s before retiring as a major. Then I chased another dream: to fly airliners. I ended up flying 737s, 727s, DC-10s and 747s for United. So I have a background in general aviation and then military fighters for 15 years and then commercial for the past 27 years. My son just got picked by the Air National Guard to fly F-15s, so the aviation legacy is continuing into the third generation.",

But a lot of the planes, especially the more modern airplanes like airliners and things like that, are what I call \"esque.\" They're very 747-esque. Or Airbus A380-esque. The Navy airplanes are very F-18-esque, but they're not F-18s. They're close enough that any aviation enthusiast would recognize them right away. But I think for proprietary reasons, the characters had to be somewhat different. CNN: Do any of the movie characters in \"Planes\" remind you of yourself? Bautista: There are a few characters who have some of my call signs from the military days. Sparky and Dusty are some of my old fighter pilot call signs. But I kind of relate to all the characters. I really like Skipper because he's an old warrior -- an old fighter plane guy from World War ll. He carries a lot in the soul of his character and in his voice. I can relate to that because of some of the unseen, unknown events in his life in the past that affect who he is. Why is he quiet? Why is he kind of a shut-in? I can relate to Dusty and his energy and wanting to go beyond his limitations. I love the fighter characters Bravo and Echo that intercept Dusty. The military sequence was the most fun to work on. CNN: Tell us about your aviation background. Apparently, the filmmakers found someone who knows how to fly a lot of different kinds of aircraft. Bautista: I'm 55. My dad flew bombers in England and France during World War II and finished his career in Strategic Air Command. My brothers and I were all fascinated by airplanes; we grew up near a military base. My younger brother and I both had our pilot's licenses by the time we turned 17, which was the youngest age to get your pilot's license. I flew anything I could get my hands on. In college, I started flying commercially, hauling boxes for FedEx back when nobody knew who they were. I flew old radial engines, twin-engine aircraft called Beech 18 taildraggers. I ended up flying every single-engine Cessna, Piper and Beechcraft built and most of the light twins that they built, like the Cessna 310, 320, 340, 414, Beechcraft Barons, Piper Navajos. Then I wanted to know if I had what it took to be a fighter pilot. I was fortunate enough to get Air Force pilot training through the Air National Guard. I flew F-4 Phantoms and F-16s before retiring as a major. Then I chased another dream: to fly airliners. I ended up flying 737s, 727s, DC-10s and 747s for United. So I have a background in general aviation and then military fighters for 15 years and then commercial for the past 27 years. My son just got picked by the Air National Guard to fly F-15s, so the aviation legacy is continuing into the third generation.\nSummary:\n",

      "article": "(Financial Times) -- BT has achieved its biggest sporting coup yet over Sky, winning the rights to show Champions League football matches in a £900 million ($1,442 million) deal. The deal, announced on Saturday, strikes at the heart of two decades of football broadcasting dominance by Sky. However, it is likely to raise questions about whether BT is paying too much for sports rights, to which it has now committed nearly £2 billion ($3.2 billion). The Champions League is Europe's football premier club competition, and BT, Sky and ITV had all hoped to secure some coverage in this week's tender. Under a three-year agreement starting in 2015, BT will be the only broadcaster to show live Champions League and Europa League games in the UK, paying £299 million ($479 million) per season. That is more than double what Sky and ITV currently pay for the same rights, suggesting that BT bid aggressively under its new chief executive Gavin Patterson. In the tender, ITV is thought to have bid about £63 million ($101 million) per season to show one live game per round, representing an increase of less than one-fifth on its current deal. Sky was prepared to increase its payments by a greater proportion, but could not match BT. \"It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation,\" a Sky spokesperson said in a statement. \"If we thought it was worth more, we'd have paid more.\" TV is part of BT's broader strategy to win customers to its premium fibre broadband packages, which include the sports channels for free at present. The Champions League deal will significantly bolster its channels as serious rivals to Sky in the eyes of viewers and advertisers. BT's shareholders will be keen to see clear returns from such significant investments from a group that has previously focused on cutting costs and streamlining its operations. The group last week revealed a good start in customer numbers, with about 2m people so far having signed up to its channels although the majority would have been existing BT customers. However, the sports rights acquisitions weighed on earnings, and analysts say it is still too early to judge the new sports TV strategy a success.

Overhead video from CNN affiliate KTLA showed firefighters working to douse a fire as most of the plane, including a visible part of its wing, lay in the middle of a road. The aircraft appeared to have hit at least one tree, but not any buildings directly. The Los Angeles city fire department said in an e-mail that one person died in the crash, though his or her identity was not released. \"No other patients discovered; no home damage from fire,\" the fire department said. It was not immediately clear how many people were aboard the aircraft at the time it went down, according to Gregor, and there were no reports of injuries on the ground. The FAA spokesman said the aircraft is registered to a Santa Monica resident. The National Transportation Safety Board will serve as the lead investigative agency looking into the crash, assisted by the FAA, according to Gregor.

Players have voiced concerns over the disparity between the money earned by stars who reach the latter stages of grand slams and those who exit in the early rounds. British newspaper the Sunday Times reported that they were planning to start a rebel event, possibly in Dubai, if pay is not increased for the Melbourne tournament in January. But the ATP, which represents the interests of male players, has denied it would help players in organize any such action. \"The ATP has been clear and repetitive in telling players that it will not organize a boycott,\" it said in a statement. \"Instead, ATP Management and players have taken a diplomatic approach this year with the grand slams to address player compensation issues. \"The grand slams are important events that generate significant revenues, and the players who perform there should share in an acceptable percentage of those revenues like they do on the ATP World Tour.\" How 'Big Four' earned a pay rise for tennis colleagues . The Australian Open, held in Melbourne every January, is one of four grand slams in tennis -- along with the French and U.S. Opens and Wimbledon. In 2012, first-round losers at the year's first major tournament were given $21,600, compared to $22,500 in France and $23,000 in the U.S. and Britain -- the latter three having increased by 20%. The biggest disparity is in Australia, which has the highest prize purse and biggest winner's check of almost $2.4 million. \"We are pleased that the discussions initiated by the ATP with each of the grand slams this year have resulted in certain prize money increases for players in 2012,\" the men's ruling body said. \"We remain focused on our active dialogue with these events about player compensation for 2013 and beyond. The players remain unified and passionate about this issue.\" Australian Open boss Craig Tiley, in New York for the U.S. Open which began on Monday, attempted to quell boycott fears. \"We are the first to say that for tennis to be a viable career, the top 250 players need to make a good living,\" he told Australian news agency AAP. \"The top 250 players in tennis make about a quarter of the amount of money in tennis as they do in golf. So that could be a good benchmark for us.

Australian kids are consuming more than two serves of fatty food and at least one sugary drink each day, which is directly having an impact on their weight gain. A long-term Deakin University study also found for each unhealthy item consumed by children, their BMI score increased. The new study looked at 4,164 children from ages four to 10, with data collected over four time periods every two years. It classed fatty foods as hamburgers, hot chips, potato chips, doughnuts, cake or chocolate. Sugary drinks included cordial, soft drinks and fruit juice. A Victorian university study has found children are eating more than two serves of fatty foods and consuming at least one sugary drink a day . It found six-years-olds consumed 1.4 serves of sugary drinks a day and 1.9 serves of fatty foods. At 10 years, this increased to 1.5 serves per day for sugary drinks. Deakin University WHO Collaborating Centre for Obesity Prevention's Dr Lynne Millar said many would say 'yes we already know this', but studies to date had been inconclusive. 'Some [found] a connection between sugary drinks and fatty foods and children's weight and others not,' she said. 'We have conducted a very robust study, and for the first time found that these foods and drinks independently contribute to childhood obesity.' Dr Millar said the study showed that consuming snack foods had become 'normalised' for children and she was shocked by the results. 'I didn't think kids on average would eat that much unhealthy food,' she said.

For each drink or high fat food consumed, the children's BMI-z score - a standardised BMI measure used specifically with children - increased by 0.015 and 0.014 units respectively. 'While the increases may seem low, they are cause for concern,' Dr Millar said. Dr Millar said a normal BMI-z score would be zero, so a score above one was considered overweight and above two was obese.

      "article": "Hands down, it's the most important monthly economic report in the race for the White House. And April's numbers from the Labor Department didn't provide President Obama a lot to brag about. \"After the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, our businesses have now created more than 4.2 million new jobs over the last 26 months, more than 1 million jobs in the six months alone. So that's the good news,\" Obama said Friday at an event in northern Virginia. But the president went on to say, \"There are still a lot of folks out of work, which means we gotta do more. If we're going to recover all the jobs lost during the recession, and if we're going to build a secure economy that strengthens the middle class, then we're going to have to do more.\" Consider this: No sitting president facing an unemployment rate more than 8% has won another term since Franklin D. Roosevelt. So the headline from the Labor Department report Friday morning that the nation's unemployment level edged down from 8.2% in March to 8.1% in April sure seemed like good news for an incumbent president fighting for re-election. Especially since just about every poll indicates that the economy remains the top issue on the minds of Americans and that jobs remain the top economic concern. CNNMoney.com: Why Obama can't match the Reagan recovery . But the Labor Department also reported that the number of jobs rose last month by 115,000, much lower than many economists had predicted. According to the report, 342,000 workers dropped out of the labor force, with the labor force participation rate, now at 63.6%, at its lowest level since 1981. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee was quick to react to the jobs numbers. \"It's a terrible and very disappointing report this morning. Clearly the American people are wondering why this recovery isn't happening faster, what's taking years and years for the recovery to occur. And we seem to be slowing down, not speeding up. This is not progress,\" Mitt Romney said Friday in an interview on Fox News just minutes after the 8:30 a.m. ET release of the Labor Department report. Romney says no celebration until 4% unemployment rate . \"A lot of American people are having difficult times, and this is not good news this morning,\" added the former Massachusetts governor, who argued the reason the rate dropped was because more people are leaving the workforce. Republicans quick to react to jobs report . Romney's strategy is simple: Make the election a referendum on the president's record on the economy and jobs, and argue that Obama isn't doing a good job on creating jobs. With six months to go until Election Day, a top Republican strategist says the jobs report spells trouble for the president. \"A disappointing jobs report means two things: One, President Obama is more likely to lose his job. Now, this election will increasingly become a referendum on Obama's performance. Voters may or may not believe Mitt Romney can turn things around, but it is becoming clearer that Obama's plan isn't going to cut it,\" says GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. \"Two, to win, President Obama has to run the most brutal, negative, polarizing campaign in history -- on every subject but the economy. He has to pit young against old, rich against poor, women against men, and try to divide the country on other issues. I don't think that's the kind of country we want to be,\" said Castellanos, who was a top media adviser for Romney's 2008 nomination bid. \"Anytime you have to explain bad news, you've already lost. The Obama campaign has done the best they can with stubbornly high unemployment, talking about the number of jobs created and not the number of people who don't have jobs. But this doesn't help the general sense of unease about the economy among middle class Americans,\" says Rich Galen, who ran Newt Gingrich's press operation when he was speaker of the House and advised Fred Thompson's 2008 Republican presidential bid. But be careful what you wish for, says Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala. \"Every time there's bad economic news for the middle class, the Champagne corks pop at one of Mitt Romney's many mansions. The bad job numbers are bad news for President Obama -- and for all Americans. So the GOP has to be careful not to celebrate bad times,\" says Begala, who was a top adviser in the Clinton White House and who now is a senior adviser to Priorities USA, the pro-Obama super PAC. So which candidate does the public think will do a better job turning things around? A CNN/ORC International poll conducted last month indicated that Americans were split on which candidate could best jumpstart the economy, with 44% saying Obama would be more likely to get the economy moving and 42% saying that Romney would do a better job to stimulate the economy. But the race for the White House is a battle for states and their electoral votes. And in two of the biggest and arguably most important battleground states, new surveys from Quinnipiac University indicate that when it comes to the economy, Romney has a slight advantage over the president.

      "article": "In the midst of the recent uprising of Islamic militants in Iraq - and the thousands of Iraqis they've slaughtered as they try to take over the violence-plagued country - former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney-Perry, a one-time assistant secretary of state, are speaking out about the series of 'wrong' decisions the Obama administration has made that made the uprising possible. Last week, a group of Islamic extremists began an insurgency throughout Iraq and have taken over several cities - including Fallujah, Tikrit, Mosul and Tel Afar - on their way to Baghdad. After saying he wouldn't send U.S. troops to the region, Obama sent 250 soldiers to guard the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Harsh: Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz - a former deputy assistant secretary of state - have harsh words for Obama's handling of the insurgency in Iraq . Jihad: Earlier this month, a jihadi group of Islamic militants called the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria began taking over cities in Iraq . The Cheneys oppose the president's plan for the uprising so far, and are critical of his actions before the uprisings that allowed the jihadi group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to grow. 'Rarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much at the expense . of so many,' the Cheneys wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. 'Too many times to count, Mr. Obama has told us he is . \"ending\" the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan‚öÑÆas though wishing made it so. His rhetoric has now come crashing into reality. Watching the black-clad . ISIS jihadists take territory once secured by American blood is final . proof, if any were needed, that America's enemies are not \"decimated.\" They are emboldened and on the march.' The Cheneys contend that the uprising in Iraq is not just a threat to Iraqis, but to Americans, as well, as the country could become a safe-haven for al Qaeda and other terrorist groups that could carry out 9/11-style attacks on the U.S. and its allies. Fore! The Cheneys say that while the situation in Iraq escalates, Obama is playing golf and talking about climate change . The Cheneys mention trips they've been on to the Middle East, where government officials are confused as to what Obama has been doing in the region following the wars in Irag and Afghanistan, and say that the president is abandoning the few friends the U.S. has in the Arab world. 'In one Arab capital, a senior official pulled out a map of Syria and . Iraq,' the Cheneys write. 'Drawing an arc with his finger from Raqqa province in northern . Syria to Anbar province in western Iraq, he said, \"They will control . this territory. Al Qaeda is building safe havens and training camps . here. Don't the Americans care?\" 'Our president doesn't seem to. Iraq is at risk of falling to a radical . Islamic terror group and Mr. Obama is talking climate change. Terrorists . take control of more territory and resources than ever before in . history, and he goes golfing. He seems blithely unaware, or indifferent . to the fact, that a resurgent al Qaeda presents a clear and present . danger to the United States of America.' Brutal: ISIS crucified this man and left a note on his body saying 'Cleanliness is a civilized matter that shows ur ethics and love for country . Murderers: ISIS has reportedly driven through Iraqi cities and indiscriminately shot at random citizens . After the Iraq War, the Cheneys say al Qaeda was nearly defeated in the country thanks primarily to military efforts by the U.S. and its allies. Rather than stay in the country and make sure the peace was preserved, Obama pulled the U.S. out of the unfinished conflict, according to the Cheneys. Mr. Obama had only to negotiate an agreement to leave behind some . residual American forces, training and intelligence capabilities to help . secure the peace. Instead, he abandoned Iraq and we are watching . American defeat snatched from the jaws of victory. The Cheneys cite a Rand study that shows a 58 percent increase in the number of Salafi-jihadists between 2010 and 2013. They say that 'in the face of this threat, Mr. Obama is busy ushering America's adversaries into positions of power in the Middle East.' 'First it was the Russians in Syria. Now, in a move that defies . credulity, he toys with the idea of ushering Iran into Iraq,' they write. 'Only a fool . would believe American policy in Iraq should be ceded to Iran, the . world's largest state sponsor of terror.' Violence: The number of Iraqis executed by ISIS since the uprising began is in the thousands . They write that there is 'a dire need for American leadership around the world' and that the president has failed our allies by abandoning conflicts before they are actually over. 'It is time the president and his allies faced some hard truths: America . remains at war, and withdrawing troops from the field of battle while . our enemies stay in the fight does not \"end\" wars. Weakness and retreat . are provocative. U.S. withdrawal from the world is disastrous and puts . our own security at risk,' the Cheneys write. They went on to quote former President - and conservative hero - Ronald Reagan. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan said, \"If history teaches anything, it . teaches that simple-minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our . adversaries is folly. It means the betrayal of our past, the squandering . of our freedom.\" President Obama is on track to securing his legacy as . the man who betrayed our past and squandered our freedom.",

      "article": "(CNN) -- More than 500 people have died in Belgium since the start of April, a higher-than-usual number which may be tied to a string of summer days with high temperatures, health authorities said Tuesday.

      "article": "A Twitter-user signposted cyber-attacks which crippled the Home Office website by flooding it with huge amounts of internet traffic, a jury has heard. Mark Johnson, 44, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, is accused of encouraging the attack by the international hacking group Anonymous, which sent the Government sites into meltdown. The prosecution say Johnson encouraged a cyber-attack on websites run by the Home Office and Home Secretary Theresa May by posting links on his Twitter page. Mark Johnson (pictured) is accused of encouraging the attack by the international hacking group Anonymous . Johnson is alleged to have posted a link on his social media account which meant other web users could join in with the hacking attack launched by the cyber activist group Anonymous in 2012. A court heard the Distributed Denial Of Service (DDOS) attack - where a website is flooded with traffic to make it crash - took place between June 15 and June 18, 2012. It began when hackers Anonymous posted a video on YouTube on June 12 which announced 'Operation Theresa May' - a two-day online assault on the Home Secretary. Home secretary Theresa May was targeted as part of a two-day online assault by hacking group Anonymous . Johnson is accused of posting a link to the code for the attack on the Home Office on his Twitter page @mlyjohn on June 15, 2012. The court heard his tweet has since been deleted and he told police somebody must have hacked into his account to post the link. But the jury of 10 women and two men were told computer experts had analysed his computer and found there was no evidence of anyone accessing his device. Johnson denies one charge of encouraging or assisting an offence under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act 1990. Timothy Devlin, opening the prosecution case on the first day of his trial at Birmingham Crown Court, said: 'What this really is a case about is computer hacking. 'The offence was what is called a Distributed Denial Of Service. What we accuse Mr Johnson of doing is helping others to crash the Home Office computers. 'DDOS is a situation where a large number of people simultaneously make requests of a website. The Crown alleges Johnson, of Josiah Wedgwood Street, assisted in the web attacks on both the Home Office website and the home secretary's constituency website by posting a 'malicious' weblink through his Twitter account which, when clicked, allowed a web-user to add their connection to the cyber assault. 'We say Mark Johnson published that link in his Twitter account,' said Mr Devlin. 'He was saying 'if you want to help close down the Home Office and Theresa May's website, here's the link'.' He added: 'We say Mark Johnson published links on Twitter for people to get involved in these joint attacks.' Mr Devlin told the court the DDOS attack used a malicious webpage which opened connections to the Home Office page in large numbers. He said the Government website received a message saying 'we are legion' - which is a phrase from the Bible used by Anonymous - every time someone clicked on the link for the attack. The court heard in just under 30 minutes from 9.34pm on June 17, 2012, 8,347 connections were made to the Government site - rendering it unresponsive to users and causing it to be taken down. The sheer weight of connections meant that an alternative 'disaster recovery' version of the site had to be put online in place of the main site, Mr Devlin told the court. Mr Devlin added: 'It (the Home Office page) was being bombarded so quickly they had to take it down and a substitute was put on the internet with reduced functionality. 'It was there to replace the real website, normal service was resumed the following day (June 18, 2012). Johnson denies one charge of encouraging or assisting an offence under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 . 'These connections, the 8,347, were made by a variety of originators of the same DDOS message being circulated. 'That means a large number of people were able to click on a connection which then sent a message to the Home Office website and that helped close it down. 'During the attack on the Home Office website, Theresa May's constituency website was also attack from links posted on Twitter. The website ceased to function. 'And what we are saying is that Mark Johnson published that link in his Twitter account. 'So what he was doing was saying if you want to help close down the Home Office and Theresa May websites then here is the link and other people look at that and click that link. 'Mr Johnson says no I didn't, it must have been somebody else using my Twitter account. 'If Mr Johnson is saying this wasn't me that posted this on my Twitter account then it must have been someone else and how did they do it because they don't have his password. 'You're going to hear evidence that on the day he was arrested all his computers were taken and they've all been examined by an expert and no malware, no Trojans or no other performance email has gone in to that account which has enabled another person to steal his password. 'So the only person who had that password was Mark Johnson.' The court heard after police traced Mr Johnson to his home he deleted his tweet from June15 and changed his Twitter account from an open setting to a private one. His @mlyjohn account, has a header picture showing numerous images of the infamous Guy Fawkes white mask motif used by Anonymous. Mr Devlin explained to the trial jury at Birmingham Crown Court that Johnson does not deny supporting some of global hacking group Anonymous' campaigns. Johnson, who wore a white shirt with a dark suit jacket, sat in the dock listening intently to proceedings. Jurors also heard in August 2012, two months after the Home Office attack, Johnson posted a link to an Anonymous group YouTube video regarding another cyber attack, which this time targeted the San Francisco public transport system in the United States.

      "article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Creating and saving jobs while boosting investment in the future are among the top goals of the Obama administration's $787 billion economic stimulus plan. President Obama chats with students at a Silver Spring, Maryland, elementary school this week. And according to a preliminary report on stimulus funding for schools by the Department of Education and the Domestic Policy Council, the stimulus plan has created jobs. State governments have created and saved at least 250,000 education jobs -- and restored nearly all their projected education budget shortfalls for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 -- according to preliminary findings released Monday by the White House. But some states that used the funds to fill existing budget gaps could face a crisis when the money runs out after 2010. And the Department of Education has chastised certain states for their stimulus funding programs and warned them that they risk their chances at getting other DOE grants down the road. The stimulus funds appropriated $48.6 billion for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund to help keep and create jobs and advance education reforms over a period of two years, the report said. The program dedicates $39.8 billion for public elementary, secondary and higher education and other services. Another $8.8 billion will go for other activities such as public safety or government services. \"To date, $35.5 billion of the SFSF allotment has been obligated and $13.2 [billion] is forthcoming,\" the report added. In a recent memo, the Department of Education's inspector general's office warned Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania about not following the rules. At issue is the government's \"maintenance of effort\" provision, which makes states receiving stimulus funds promise to maintain funding at fiscal year 2006 levels. The provision also requires states to pledge to use these funds to advance certain education reforms: increasing teacher effectiveness, implementing statewide data systems, and providing support for struggling schools. The September 30 memo pointed out states are using K-12 stimulus funds to fill gaps in their education budgets due to decreasing revenues and resources. Pennsylvania's actions led to a terse letter on June 18 from Education Secretary Arne Duncan to Gov. Ed Rendell. The letter said: \"If a State has disproportionately reduced its education budget and/or if a State has done nothing more than backfill budget holes with these dollars when the State had other resources available to it, such as a rainy-day fund, the State's competitive position to receive ... competitive grants may be negatively impacted.\" Those states employing the practice, some argue, will face dire straits in fiscal year 2011 when the stimulus funding runs out. \"States and districts were repeatedly warned about funding [problems],\" said Chad Aldeman, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan think tank Education Sector. But Aldeman notes that there may have been a lack of communication between states and the federal government over how to spend the money. \"They [states] were told to focus on one-time investments as much as possible,\" he said. \"At the same time, the Department of Education sold this as a job and reform package. ... They say on one hand, preserve and create jobs. On the other hand, they talk about education reform.\" The Obama administration argues the early results from Monday's report show the money already is having an effect. \"This is one more indication of how the Recovery Act is helping soften the blow of tough times, by keeping educators on the job and teachers in the classroom,\" Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement. But there has been criticism over the way the government is handling and tracking the Recovery Act. \"If these issues and the stimulus money being made available ... are not handled carefully, conflict and even paralysis are likely to ensue,\" said Pedro A. Noguera, a professor at New York University and director of the Metropolitan Center for Urban Education, in a recent CNN.com commentary. \"The president may even inadvertently alienate an important core constituency that he will surely need in the years ahead -- public school teachers.\" Aldeman points out that some of the accountability problems seen with the Recovery Act likely occurred during the time the federal government was doling out money to states. \"The states were cutting employees that were designed to draft federal grants and to track and follow money as it flowed through [at the same time the federal government was giving out stimulus funds]. ... They were cutting monitors and accountants that would have been able to follow this better,\" he said. Despite some of the accountability and tracking problems, Duncan said early feedback from states \"also tells us that many districts are using stimulus dollars in ways that will move us beyond the status quo.\" And Duncan's concept can be seen in school programs cited in Monday's report. Jim McIntyre, superintendent of the Knox County, Tennessee, schools, said the stimulus funding is not only helping to create jobs in the short term but also investing in the future after the funding is gone. \"Our philosophy has really been around making some investments in the short term to build our capacity so that those investments will continue to pay off in the long term around student achievement and learning, long after the dollars are gone,\" he said. McIntyre's school district was cited in the stimulus report as a success story for facilitating greater inclusion of students with disabilities into the regular educational setting. The funds, according to the report, helped the district to add special education instructors in its middle and high schools, \"while supporting needed training for teachers and aides who work with special education students.\" Tennessee, McIntyre said, has been supportive in helping his school district plan and obtain stimulus money to \"really invest in our people and hopefully invest in our kids for the long term.\" The Department of Education report offered other examples that it said showed funding is working, such as: . \"In several communities these dollars are being used to enhance information systems to help measure progress by both teachers and students in meeting educational standards,\" the report added.

The 29-year-old overall World Cup champion recorded an unprecedented 24th podium finish of the season by claiming victory in the giant slalom at Lenzerheide, Switerland. Any disappointment at missing out on the downhill title to Lindsey Vonn was well and truly vanquished as Maze stormed to yet more success. The Slovenia star, who has already won the super-G and slalom crystal globes, is only the second skier ever to break the 2000 points barrier in the season. Her total of 2,414 points, a record, came after she clocked a time of two minutes 16.67 seconds over the two legs to finish ahead of France's Tessa Worley and home favorite Lara Gut. \"I have even impressed myself. It has been an incredible season, \"Maze told reporters. \"If someone had said to me before the start of the season I would achieve all this, I would have said they were mad,\" said Maze. \"I don't think that this is the fruit of just one year of hard work. \"One obviously requires talent and the need to work hard, but also to have a good team round oneself. Skiing is an individual sport, but there is a team around you to help you.\" From the 900 points on offer for the Giant Slalom title, Maze collected 800 of them, winning on five occasions as well as finishing second three times and third once. She told the competition's official website: \"It's an incredible record, but I could have scored more points if the last Super G and Downhill weren't canceled. \"I'm impressed by all these achievements. It's been an amazing season for me. My skiing has been so good. I started with a win and finished with another one. \"That's the way to go when you're so strong. I'm so proud of me and my team. I also really would like to thank the fans for their great support.\" In the men's race, Germany's Felix Neureuther claimed victory ahead of Marcel Hirscher and Ivica Kostelic. \"It's very good to go into the summer like that but I know I will need to work pretty hard too,\" Neureuther told the FIS website. \"Marcel was always the men to beat this season and I hope to do that more often next year. I'm so happy it's over now, my back hurts and I definitely feel like an old man needs some rest.\" Austria's Hirscher, who had already secured the small globe for the slalom, claimed his ninth top three finish of the season to equal the all-time men's record for single-season World Cup slalom podiums. Only Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden in 1976/77 and Italy's Alberto Tomba in 1991/92 had previously managed the feat. \"It's amazing, it was quite difficult keeping the pace during the whole season but I am proud that I made nearly no mistakes,\" he told the competition's official website. \"I am also really happy about the Slalom title on top of the Overall one as it's the first time I won it.\"",

      "article": "A charge of making a false bomb threat has been dropped against a man who carried a backpack containing a rice cooker near a crowd marking the first anniversary of the Boston Marathon bombings in April, prosecutors said Wednesday. Investigators dropped the charge because they say the suspect, Kevin Edson, 25, did not communicate an \"overt threat that an incendiary device would be detonated,\" Jake Wark, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney, told CNN. Edson was arrested after carrying the backpack with a rice cooker near the finish line on Boylston Street in Boston while survivors of the 2013 bombing were commemorating its anniversary on April 15. In the 2013 attack, two pressure-cooker bombs exploded, killing three people and wounding at least 264 others. A barefoot Edson, carrying a backpack and wearing black clothes with a veil and hat covering his face, screamed and yelled near the end of the anniversary event on Boylston Street, drawing officers' attention, police said. Wark said prosecutors decided to drop the charge after reviewing statements Edson made at the scene as well as video shot by onlookers. Edson still faces charges of disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, disturbing a public assembly and possession or use of a hoax device. His next court date is scheduled for August 27. The charge of making a false bomb threat carried the most severe sentence upon conviction -- up to 20 years in prison. Possession or use of a hoax device carries a maximum sentence of five years, Wark said. A judge in April set bail at $100,000 for Edson. The judge also ordered Edson, also known as Kayvon Edson, to be seen at a state hospital that evaluates defendants' sanity after a mental health professional told the judge that Edson has a history of psychiatric disturbances.

UK holidaymakers pay between £13 and £91 each, per flight, depending on the route, but other European countries pay as little as 90p per flight.

Campaign group A Fair Tax on Flying looked at five European countries that levy a comparable tax - Britain, Austria, Italy, France and Germany. The UK has three levels of APD, £13.00 a person for short haul flights, like those to most European countries, £69 a head mid-haul, which includes Dubai and Israel and £91 each for those going long haul.

Chancellor George Osborne's plans to claw back child benefit from better-off families have been criticised for being too complicated . Thousands of people earning more than £50,000 will lose some of their pay if they move in with a new partner who has children, accountants have warned. Tax experts at Deloitte said the ‚öÑ≤bizarre' anomaly was the result of government plans to claw back child benefit from homes where at least one resident is a higher earner. The changes are due to come into force in just 10 weeks, and the Treasury has been forced to insist they remain on track despite hundreds of thousands of families affected being in the dark that they will lose money from January 1. Letters are due to be sent to all those paid under PAYE and earning more than £50,000 by HM Revenue and Customs next week. Yesterday MailOnline revealed child benefit is being paid to 40,000 children living outside the UK, despite plans to cut the money for families in the UK. Under the changes, if one person in the home earns £50,000 or more, the entitlement to child benefit will be gradually cut. If anyone earns more than £60,000, they will lose child benefit all together. But instead of reducing the amount of child benefit paid out, the money is to be clawed back in additional tax imposed on the higher earner, regardless of whether they are the person who receives child benefit or even a parent. It means 500,000 people will have to fill out self-assessment tax forms for the first time. Patricia Mock, a tax director in Deloitte's private client services division, said: ‚öÑ≤If you have a standard family with 2.4 children and two married parents all living together then the system is reasonably straightforward. ‚öÑ≤But it can get really bizarre. Take that straightforward family. If the parents get divorced and the children live with the mother who has a new partner, and that partner is the higher earner, then he gets [to pay] the clawback even though they are not his children,' she told the Daily Telegraph. Ms Mock added: ‚öÑ≤Some scenarios look overcomplicated, but in today's complex family arrangements, they may well happen.' If an estranged father is claiming child benefit for children who live with their mother and this father has a new partner – who happens to earn more than him – then this partner may be liable to pay the money back if they earn over the threshold. A spokesman for HMRC insisted the process of explaining the changes was on course, but admitted new partners could be liable for the charge following a divorce. He added: ‚öÑ≤Letters explaining the new child benefit rules are ready to be sent and will be issued in batches from next week, on schedule and according to plan. 'There are no delays, and plenty of time for those affected to consider their options and make an informed choice in time for the 7 January rule change. ‚öÑ≤We will also launch a section on our website designed specifically to help taxpayers with the new arrangements.'",

      "article": "(CNN) -- He won the World Cup with Italy in 2006 -- now Gennaro Gattuso is being investigated on match fixing charges. The 35-year-old was an integral part of Marcelo Lippi's squad, playing all 180 minutes of the final against France, which Italy eventually won on penalties. But on Tuesday he was named in a statement on the official website of the Italian Football Federation that provided an update into an ongoing match fixing investigation by prosecutors in Cremona. It said that four men had been arrested over matches that were allegedly fixed in Italy's top tier three seasons ago. Gattuso, as well as another former AC Milan star, Cristian Brocchi, who also played for Inter and Lazio, were not detained but had their homes raided as part of the probe which is focused on games in the 2010-11 season. The combative midfielder spent 13 years at Milan, winning two European Champions League titles, two Serie A crowns and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2007. He was also part of the victorious Italy squad that won the 2006 World Cup in Germany, defeating France on penalties in the final. Gattuso turned to management after his playing career ended, taking charge at Swiss club Sion before he was relieved of his duties. His next appointment saw him take the reins at Palermo prior to the start of the current league season in Italy but he was sacked after winning just two games and replaced by Giuseppe Iachini. These allegations are the latest in a long line of stories that have plagued Italian football over recent years as prosecutors continue their probe into illegal betting and match fixing. Juventus manager Antonio Conte was handed with a 10-month suspension, later reduced to four, for failing to report match fixing while in charge of Siena, who then played in the Italian second tier. Former Lazio and Italy striker Giuseppe Signori was banned for five years while Stefano Mauri, and ex-Atalanta captain Cristiano Doni have also served suspensions. Back in 2005 the Calciopoli scandal resulted in Juventus being stripped of their 2005 and 2006 Serie A titles as well as being demoted to Serie B, Italy's second league. Elsewhere, earlier this month 11 men in Estonia were charged with fixing 17 matches, including three in the Europa League -- Europe's second-tier competition -- to the tune of 108,000 euros ($146,730). In November, seven arrests were made in the United Kingdom as part of an ongoing investigation into match fixing in English professional football's lower levels.

The service's European Command said this week that 12 A-10 Thunderbolts would be deployed to Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, which was formed after Russia's intervention in Ukraine over the past year. \"The Air Force is increasing rotational presence in Europe to reassure our allies and partner nations that our commitment to European security is a priority,\" Lt. Gen. Tom Jones, vice commander, United States Air Forces in Europe -- Air Forces Africa, said in a statement. The Air Force said besides operating in Germany, the A-10s will be forward deployed to other partner nations in Eastern Europe. U.S. forces have operated out of bases in Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Poland, among others, in the past year. The A-10, also known as the \"Warthog,\" was designed in the 1970s to support ground troops in Europe against the tanks and armored vehicles of the then-Soviet Union. Though the jets can carry a variety of bombs and missiles, they are best known for their nose-mounted, seven-barrel 30 mm Gatling gun that can fire almost 4,000 rounds per minute, enough to quickly blow apart a tank. The planes are also durable, with the pilot protected from ground fire by a wrapping of titanium often called \"the bathtub.\" And they are designed for easy maintenance in battlefield areas, with interchangeable parts for the right and left sides of the aircraft. Those capabilities have been battle-proven in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans. Late last year, A-10s were deployed in support of Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in January that the A-10s had flown 11% of the Air Force's missions against ISIS despite coming into the conflict more than two months after initial U.S. involvement. Despite its current usefulness, the A-10 is on the Defense Department's chopping block, with the Air Force wanting to turn over the jet's ground support mission to its newest fighter, the F-35. Critics of the move say the A-10 can do better than the F-35 because it can get lower and slower, allowing pilots to get real eyes on targets. And they say it is way cheaper than the F-35, with a flight hour for the A-10 costing roughly half of what it costs to operate the F-35, according to numerous reports. The Air Force says it just doesn't have the money to support the A-10, which will be more than 40 years old at its planned retirement in 2019, and its newest, more advanced aircraft. \"It's not about not liking or not wanting the A-10. It's about some very tough decisions that we have to make to recapitalize an Air Force for the threat 10 years from now,\" Gen. Mark Welsh, the Air Force chief of staff, said in January.

      "article": "(CNN) -- As the U.S. continues limited, targeted airstrikes for the third day in Iraq, political divisions around the scope of U.S. involvement are emerging in Washington. Top-ranking Democrats who appeared on political talk shows Sunday advocated for a limited mission and insisted that the Iraqi government must respond to the growing threat of the extreme militant group ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State but formerly was known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Republicans, meanwhile, are advocating a far more aggressive stance, insisting that ISIS poses a direct threat to the U.S. They urged President Barack Obama to do more than the limited airstrikes he announced Friday. ISIS, which obtained sustained power in parts of Syria, has expanded its deadly grip on parts of Iraq, especially the Kurdish north, where tens of thousands of Yazidi minorities had been forced into mountains, where they're stranded without food and water. Up to 60 children are among those who have died from the extreme conditions. Thousands of Yazidis rescued, Iraqi Human Rights Ministry spokesman says . Dehydration or massacre: Thousands caught in ISIS chokehold . The militant group executes civilians who don't adhere to its version of Sunni Islam. Its goal is to create an Islamic caliphate, which it claims it has already done, calling the regions they control in Iraq and Syria the Islamic State. Obama announced airstrikes to protect the hundreds of Americans working in the region and said humanitarian assistance to Kurdish minorities would be part of a limited mission that he described as a \"long-term project.\" But in Washington, Republicans harshly criticized the President and his mission, saying it is too little, too late. The U.S. role . \"ISIS continues to make gains everywhere,\" Republican Sen. John McCain said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Obama's approach to protect military and diplomatic personnel in the area, McCain said, is \"narrow\" in scope and \"clearly very, very ineffective, to say the least.\" \"That's not a strategy,\" he said, calling for additional airstrikes in Iraq and Syria to dismantle ISIS and to provide additional military equipment to the Kurds and the Syrian fighters who oppose ISIS. Officials: U.S. airstrikes pound ISIS militants firing at Iraq's Yazidis . That sentiment for an expanded involvement was echoed by Rep. Peter King, R-New York. \"I am saying we should do whatever we have to do,\" the House Homeland Security Committee member said on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" including, \"we take nothing off the table.\" On Sunday, Democrats, however, expressed support for the President's targeted airstrikes and cautioned against any broader involvement. \"Escalating it is not on the cards,\" Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, said on \"Meet the Press.\" \"We cannot send the troops. We must not send the troops.\" But King insisted his support for a broader operation, which includes \"massive aircraft,\" does not involve U.S. combat troops back into the country after nearly a decade of war and three years after the troops left. \"Let's not set up the false argument that there have to be troops on the ground,\" he said. The role of Iraqis . Democrats said Sunday that the U.S. can do little beyond provide humanitarian assistance and protect American personnel.

Top-ranking Democrats who appeared on political talk shows Sunday advocated for a limited mission and insisted that the Iraqi government must respond to the growing threat of the extreme militant group ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State but formerly was known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Republicans, meanwhile, are advocating a far more aggressive stance, insisting that ISIS poses a direct threat to the U.S. They urged President Barack Obama to do more than the limited airstrikes he announced Friday. ISIS, which obtained sustained power in parts of Syria, has expanded its deadly grip on parts of Iraq, especially the Kurdish north, where tens of thousands of Yazidi minorities had been forced into mountains, where they're stranded without food and water. Up to 60 children are among those who have died from the extreme conditions. Thousands of Yazidis rescued, Iraqi Human Rights Ministry spokesman says . Dehydration or massacre: Thousands caught in ISIS chokehold . The militant group executes civilians who don't adhere to its version of Sunni Islam. Its goal is to create an Islamic caliphate, which it claims it has already done, calling the regions they control in Iraq and Syria the Islamic State. Obama announced airstrikes to protect the hundreds of Americans working in the region and said humanitarian assistance to Kurdish minorities would be part of a limited mission that he described as a \"long-term project.\" But in Washington, Republicans harshly criticized the President and his mission, saying it is too little, too late. The U.S. role . \"ISIS continues to make gains everywhere,\" Republican Sen. John McCain said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Obama's approach to protect military and diplomatic personnel in the area, McCain said, is \"narrow\" in scope and \"clearly very, very ineffective, to say the least.\" \"That's not a strategy,\" he said, calling for additional airstrikes in Iraq and Syria to dismantle ISIS and to provide additional military equipment to the Kurds and the Syrian fighters who oppose ISIS. Officials: U.S. airstrikes pound ISIS militants firing at Iraq's Yazidis . That sentiment for an expanded involvement was echoed by Rep. Peter King, R-New York. \"I am saying we should do whatever we have to do,\" the House Homeland Security Committee member said on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" including, \"we take nothing off the table.\" On Sunday, Democrats, however, expressed support for the President's targeted airstrikes and cautioned against any broader involvement. \"Escalating it is not on the cards,\" Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, said on \"Meet the Press.\" \"We cannot send the troops. We must not send the troops.\" But King insisted his support for a broader operation, which includes \"massive aircraft,\" does not involve U.S. combat troops back into the country after nearly a decade of war and three years after the troops left. \"Let's not set up the false argument that there have to be troops on the ground,\" he said. The role of Iraqis . Democrats said Sunday that the U.S. can do little beyond provide humanitarian assistance and protect American personnel. They said it is ultimately up to Iraqis to address the crisis engulfing their country. \"Only Iraq can save Iraq,\" Durbin said. \"If Iraqis come together, al-Maliki put in power someone in power with the Shias and Kurds, perhaps they can do it themselves.\" The U.S. relationship with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has deteriorated.

The case involved former Army Sgt. Tracey Cooper-Harris, an Iraq and Afghanistan war veteran who sued the department last year after it denied dependency benefits to her wife -- whom she legally married in California -- because the federal government didn't recognize same-sex marriages. While Cooper-Harris' case moved through the court system, the Supreme Court in June rejected the part of DOMA that denied federal benefits to same-sex partners, even those legally married. That left Title 38 of the U.S. Code, parts of which ban veterans' benefits for same-sex spouses. In Thursday's ruling, Judge Consuelo B. Marshall, after noting the DOMA rejection, ruled that the government couldn't use Title 38 to deny benefits to Cooper-Harris' wife, Maggie Cooper. Marshall cited defense experts who argued veterans' benefits are an essential promise to service members, helping retention and recruiting.

      "article": "Detained: Bradley Manning is escorted from the courthouse in Maryland today . Defence attorneys for Bradley Manning, the young soldier accused of leaking government secrets, revealed today that Manning, a gay soldier in the era of ‚öÑ≤don't ask, don't tell,' had an alter-ego named Breanna Manning. In the pre-trial hearing, his lawyers claim gender identity disorder played a role in Manning's mental and emotional problems that should have barred him from having access to sensitive material. They said they found medical information about female hormone treatments in Manning's room in Baghdad. While prosecutors objected to the line of questioning, Manning's military attorney Major Matthew Kemkes said Manning's gender identity disorder and homosexuality was paramount, because it would show 'what was going on in my client's mind. Manning, 24, is accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive items to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks. The leaked secrets include Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, State Department cables and a classified military video of a 2007 American helicopter attack in Iraq that killed 11 unarmed men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver. The Obama administration says the released information has threatened valuable military and diplomatic sources and strained America's relations with other governments. Manning's lawyers argue that much of the information that was classified by the Pentagon posed no risk. Turning the guns: The young soldier's lawyer immediately turned fire against the investigating officer - claiming the proceedings were biased against Manning . The military is conducting a hearing at an Army post outside Washington to determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to bring Manning to trial, where he could face a term of life in prison as a traitor. An intelligence officer who worked with Manning said today that the soldier was considered to have an especially high understanding of enemy threats in Iraq and had to be trusted to keep the material he saw private. The description of Private Manning came at the beginning of the third day of the military hearing. Captain Casey Fulton testified for the prosecution that Manning had a 'top secret' security clearance, enabling him to view a wide range of classified material. None of the material posted on WikiLeaks was classified higher than 'secret'. Fulton said Manning was regarded as having a . better understanding than other analysts of enemy threats in Iraq. She . said analysts such as Manning, known as all-source analysts, were . trained to gather intelligence from a wide array of . sources. Fulton said analysts are trained not . to disclose classified information and are not allowed to burn . classified information onto CDs for personal use. But she said it was . impossible to supervise them 100 per cent of the time. 'You have to trust that they'll safeguard the material the way that they've been taught,' she said.. Accused: Bradley Manning, 24, is blamed for the largest leak of state secrets in American history . Military court: U.S. Army courtroom sketch shows a member of the prosecution team speaking during the hearing of Bradley Manning in at Fort Meade in Maryland . Army criminal investigators described . evidence they collected that links Manning to the WikiLeaks website's . collection of U.S. military and diplomatic secrets. Among the first issues to arise on Saturday was whether Manning's sexual orientation is relevant to the case against him. The . basis for the charges Manning faces are transcripts of online chats . with a confidant-turned-government-informant in which Manning allegedly . confesses his ties to WikiLeaks and also reveals he is gay. Maj . Kemkes asked Special Agent Toni Graham, an Army criminal investigator, . whether she had talked to people who believed Manning was gay or found . evidence among his belongings relating to gender-identity disorder. The condition often is described as a mental diagnosis in which people believe they were born the wrong sex. Graham said such questions were irrelevant to the investigation. 'We already knew before we arrived that Pfc. Manning was a homosexual,' Graham said. Prosecutors objected several times to the questions. Kemkes responded that if the government can argue that Manning intended to leak secrets, 'what is going on in my client's mind is very important.' During its cross examination of Graham, Manning's defense team also sought to convince the court that not all of the material he is accused of leaking is classified. Graham, who collected evidence from Manning's living quarters and workplace, testified that among the items seized was a DVD marked 'secret' that contained a military video showing the 2007 incident in which Apache attack helicopters gunned down unarmed men in Iraq. The video was taken from the . cockpit of one the helicopters. WikiLeaks posted the video in April . 2010, sparking questions about the military's rules of engagement and whether more needed to be done to . prevent civilian casualties. The gunners can be heard laughing and . referring to the men as 'dead bastards.' Kemkes, one of Manning's lawyers, . asked Graham whether she knew the video was unclassified. She said she . didn't. 'In fact, it was an unclassified video,' Kemkes said. Emotional turmoil: Manning's lawyers say he was a gay soldier at a time when homosexuals were barred from serving openly . Although WikiLeaks had been . posting sensitive information to the Web since 2006, release of the . Apache video drew worldwide attention to the organization as it prepared . to publish secret documents on the war in Afghanistan. Manning's appearances Friday and . Saturday in the Fort Meade courtroom mark the first time he has been . seen in public after 19 months in detention. The Oklahoma native comes to court in . Army camouflage fatigues and wearing dark-rimmed glasses. Slight and . serious, he takes notes during the proceedings. An Army appeals court on Friday . rejected a defense effort to have the presiding officer, Lt. Col. Paul . Almanza, because of alleged bias. Separately, lawyers for WikiLeaks and . founder Julian Assange are asking the military's highest appeals court . to guarantee two seats in the Fort Meade courtroom. Manning's hearing is open to the . public, with limited seating. Inside the courtroom, no civilian . recording equipment is allowed. Instead of a judge, a presiding . officer delivers a recommendation as to whether prosecutors have enough . evidence to bring a suspect to trial. A military commander then makes the final decision. Manning supporters: Hundreds of demonstrators march in support of Bradley Manning outside his military court hearing in Fort Meade on Saturday . In protest: Chris Hager of Falls Church, Virginia (right) dressed as Guantanamo detainee outside the opening of WikiLeaks suspect Bradley Manning's pre-trial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland . Defiant: A demonstrator carrying an image of soldier Bradley Manning, marches with hundreds of others outside Fort Meade in Maryland today . The case has spawned an . international support network of people who believe the U.S. government . has gone too far in seeking to punish Manning. More than 100 people gathered . outside Fort Meade for a march in support of Manning, some holding signs . declaring 'Americans have the right to know,' 'Free Bradley Manning' and 'Blowing the whistle on war crimes is not a crime.'

Tens of thousands spent Thanksgiving just as others did in New England when Turkey Day was first observed in the 17th century: without electricity. In New Hampshire, more than 133,000 customers were still without power early Friday. \"They're saying it will be a multiday event,\" said Fallon Reed, the assistant operations chief for the New Hampshire Division of Homeland Security & Emergency Management. In Maine, there were as many as 110,000 customers without electricity on Thanksgiving morning, but milder Turkey Day temperatures allowed for workers to cut that number down by more than two thirds by night's end. Central Maine Power Co. reported that less than 32,000 customers had no power, while Emera, the state's second-largest utility company, reported that less than 1,000 customers were without electricity after a Wednesday nor'easter dumped more than a foot of snow across a dozen Maine cities, WMTW reported. \"Heavy, wet snow brought down power lines and tree limbs interrupting service to thousands of people throughout Maine,\" Emera posted on its website. \"Crews will remain in the field through the overnight hours and into Friday until all customers are fully restored.\" Despite the setback, the heartiest of New Englanders wouldn't let the lack of electricity prevent them from enjoying the heartiest of meals. Lots of Mainers took to Twitter either to poke fun at or moan about the weather.

A study has found that marrying later in life is financially beneficial for women, but not for men. The University of Virginia has published a report that college-educated women who wed in their thirties earn an average of 56per cent more than those who get married a decade earlier. Conversely, men who settle down in their twenties have higher incomes than those who wait until after 30, no matter their education. The National Marriage Project's study, entitled Knot Yet: The Benefits and Costs of Delayed Marriage in America, examines the consequences of marrying later, a growing trend in the U.S. It notes that the average age of marriage is at an all-time high of 27 for women and 29 for men, compared to 1990 when the averages were 23 for women and 26 for men. But while women have actually benefited financially from delayed marriages, men who wed earlier in life tend to be more successful later on. The study says that childbirth plays a role in these results. Around two-thirds of lifetime income growth takes . place during the first ten years of a career, according to clinical psychologist Meg Jay. Since college-educated women who marry in their twenties also tend to have their first baby earlier, forcing them to take a break from their careers, they can take longer to climb the corporate ladder. But getting hitched at a younger age tends to be a good career move for men, perhaps because married men 'are more sure of themselves compared to single men,' leading to more productivity, suggests Business Insider. Not all women who wait until their thirties to get married reap the benefits, however. The study also found that while college-educated women profit from delayed marriage, those without a degree do not.

      "article": "The second-largest school district in California is raising eyebrows after its police force recently acquired a military-grade armored vehicle. The San Diego Unified School District now has a 14-ton M-RAP ‚öÑÆ short for mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle ‚öÑÆ that American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan usually ride into combat to protect them against explosives. The $700,000 tank was donated to the school district under a military program that distributes surplus military equipment to local police agencies. The federal initiative has come under heavy criticism after police in Ferguson, Missouri, used military weapons usually reserved for trained US Marines against regular citizens protesting the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, 18. This digitally altered image shows what school police officials in San Diego want their new armored truck to look like . This image shows another potential look for the military-grade truck obtained by California's second-largest school district . The armored vehicle has been stripped of any weaponry and will possibly be painted white to resemble an ambulance. It only cost the school district $5,000 for shipping from Texas, KSWB reported. But even within the school district, officials are questioning the need for such equipment. 'The symbol of having an armored vehicle in the district is not the message we want to send to schools,' school board trustee Scott Barnett told the San Diego Union-Tribune. 'But we have it now,' added Barnett, whose school board wasn't consulted when the police force applied for the tank. 'Can we leverage that vehicle to fund something we really need ‚öÑÆ new patrol cars?' The school district's police chief, Rueben Littejohn, says the truck is intended to be used as a rescue vehicle that could evacuated up to 40 children in the event of an emergency. 'It's not the militarization of schools,' Littlejohn told the Union-Tribune. 'The vehicle has been stripped . of all offensive equipment and it's been repurposed for humanitarian . purposes.' American soldiers in Afghanistan relax prior to a mission using a mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle, one of which has now been redirected to a school district in California . Soldiers in Afghanistan use mine-resistant vehicles like the one now housed amid yellow schoolbuses in San Diego . 'After Sandy Hook there was a lot of conversation about what folks should do ‚öÑÆ what do you do for that kind of situation?' the police chief told the newspaper. 'My team took that very seriously and came up with some creative solutions, this being one of them.' School safety expert Robert Macy disagrees. 'A school that has someone in charge of the school safety plan and . someone in charge of what you do when someone is on campus and they . practice the protocols ‚öÑÆ you are going to get more mileage out of that . than many armed vehicles,' Macy, who heads the International Trauma Center, told VICE News. 'It's not as easy as putting big heavy weaponry on campus.' 'A tank is cartoonish,' he added. 'It gives the school a false sense of security.'",

      "prompt": "Write a three sentence summary of the article.\nArticle:\nThe second-largest school district in California is raising eyebrows after its police force recently acquired a military-grade armored vehicle. The San Diego Unified School District now has a 14-ton M-RAP ‚öÑÆ short for mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle ‚öÑÆ that American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan usually ride into combat to protect them against explosives. The $700,000 tank was donated to the school district under a military program that distributes surplus military equipment to local police agencies. The federal initiative has come under heavy criticism after police in Ferguson, Missouri, used military weapons usually reserved for trained US Marines against regular citizens protesting the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown, 18. This digitally altered image shows what school police officials in San Diego want their new armored truck to look like . This image shows another potential look for the military-grade truck obtained by California's second-largest school district . The armored vehicle has been stripped of any weaponry and will possibly be painted white to resemble an ambulance. It only cost the school district $5,000 for shipping from Texas, KSWB reported. But even within the school district, officials are questioning the need for such equipment. 'The symbol of having an armored vehicle in the district is not the message we want to send to schools,' school board trustee Scott Barnett told the San Diego Union-Tribune. 'But we have it now,' added Barnett, whose school board wasn't consulted when the police force applied for the tank. 'Can we leverage that vehicle to fund something we really need ‚öÑÆ new patrol cars?' The school district's police chief, Rueben Littejohn, says the truck is intended to be used as a rescue vehicle that could evacuated up to 40 children in the event of an emergency. 'It's not the militarization of schools,' Littlejohn told the Union-Tribune. 'The vehicle has been stripped . of all offensive equipment and it's been repurposed for humanitarian . purposes.' American soldiers in Afghanistan relax prior to a mission using a mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle, one of which has now been redirected to a school district in California . Soldiers in Afghanistan use mine-resistant vehicles like the one now housed amid yellow schoolbuses in San Diego . 'After Sandy Hook there was a lot of conversation about what folks should do ‚öÑÆ what do you do for that kind of situation?' the police chief told the newspaper. 'My team took that very seriously and came up with some creative solutions, this being one of them.' School safety expert Robert Macy disagrees. 'A school that has someone in charge of the school safety plan and . someone in charge of what you do when someone is on campus and they . practice the protocols ‚öÑÆ you are going to get more mileage out of that . than many armed vehicles,' Macy, who heads the International Trauma Center, told VICE News. 'It's not as easy as putting big heavy weaponry on campus.' 'A tank is cartoonish,' he added. 'It gives the school a false sense of security.'\nSummary:\n",

The villages are near Chibok, scene of the April 14 abduction of more than 200 schoolgirls, .

      "article": "(CNN) -- An appeals court ruling has raised the possibility that Guatemalan women will be able to seek asylum in the United States because of the high rates of femicide in that country. A Guatemalan woman seeking asylum based on her belief that she would not be safe in her native country will have her case reviewed, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday. Lesly Yajayra Perdomo, a native of Guatemala who entered the United States illegally as a teenager to join her mother in 1991, was facing deporation in 2003. She requested asylum \"because she feared persecution as a member of a particular social group consisting of women between the ages of fourteen and forty,\" according to the court document. In particular, Perdomo argued that women in Guatemala \"were murdered at a high rate with impunity.\" An immigration judge denied her claim, and the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the decision. Monday's ruling remands the case to the BIA for further proceedings. Perdomo, who lives in Reno, Nevada, and works as a Medicaid account executive at a medical facility there, is not assured asylum, but the decision gives her and countless other Guatemalan women the possibility of remaining in the United States. A key issue in the case is whether Guatemalan women are too broad of a group to be considered a protected \"particular social group\" eligible for asylum. That's what the BIA decided when it upheld the immigration judge's ruling, calling it \"merely a demographic division ... rather than a particular social group.\" The three-judge panel at the appeals court, however, found that the decision was \"inconsistent with its own precedent and this court's case law.\" It is important to note that the appeals court stopped short of saying Perdomo deserved asylum, only saying that she was eligible for it, Kevin Johnson, Dean of the University of California-Davis Law School, told CNN. Proving that Perdomo will face persecution if she is returned to Guatemala and that the country doesn't protect its young women will be hard to prove, he said. Any other Guatemalan women hoping to take advantage of this week's ruling will have to do the same. \"I don't think there's going to be a flood of Guatemalan women applying for asylum tomorrow,\" Johnson said. \"This is part of a trend among U.S. courts to ensure women are afforded protection under asylum laws.\" According to Amnesty International, between 2001 and 2006, more than 1,900 Guatemalan women and girls were killed. Many of those killings involved sexual violence and \"exceptional cruelty,\" the organization said.",

A Guatemalan woman seeking asylum based on her belief that she would not be safe in her native country will have her case reviewed, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday. Lesly Yajayra Perdomo, a native of Guatemala who entered the United States illegally as a teenager to join her mother in 1991, was facing deporation in 2003. She requested asylum \"because she feared persecution as a member of a particular social group consisting of women between the ages of fourteen and forty,\" according to the court document. In particular, Perdomo argued that women in Guatemala \"were murdered at a high rate with impunity.\" An immigration judge denied her claim, and the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the decision. Monday's ruling remands the case to the BIA for further proceedings. Perdomo, who lives in Reno, Nevada, and works as a Medicaid account executive at a medical facility there, is not assured asylum, but the decision gives her and countless other Guatemalan women the possibility of remaining in the United States. A key issue in the case is whether Guatemalan women are too broad of a group to be considered a protected \"particular social group\" eligible for asylum. That's what the BIA decided when it upheld the immigration judge's ruling, calling it \"merely a demographic division ... rather than a particular social group.\" The three-judge panel at the appeals court, however, found that the decision was \"inconsistent with its own precedent and this court's case law.\" It is important to note that the appeals court stopped short of saying Perdomo deserved asylum, only saying that she was eligible for it, Kevin Johnson, Dean of the University of California-Davis Law School, told CNN. Proving that Perdomo will face persecution if she is returned to Guatemala and that the country doesn't protect its young women will be hard to prove, he said. Any other Guatemalan women hoping to take advantage of this week's ruling will have to do the same. \"I don't think there's going to be a flood of Guatemalan women applying for asylum tomorrow,\" Johnson said. \"This is part of a trend among U.S. courts to ensure women are afforded protection under asylum laws.\" According to Amnesty International, between 2001 and 2006, more than 1,900 Guatemalan women and girls were killed. Many of those killings involved sexual violence and \"exceptional cruelty,\" the organization said.\nSummary:\n",
