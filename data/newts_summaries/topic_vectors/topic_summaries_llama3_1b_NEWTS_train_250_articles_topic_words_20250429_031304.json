      "article": "The president of the World Bank on Saturday warned the United States was just 'days away' from causing a global economic disaster unless politicians come up with a plan to raise the nation's debt limit and avoid default. 'We're now five days away from a very dangerous moment. I urge US policymakers to quickly come to a resolution before they reach the debt ceiling deadline... Inaction could result in interest rates rising, confidence falling and growth slowing,' World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in a briefing following a meeting of the bank's Development Committee. 'If this comes to pass, it could be a disastrous event for the developing world, and that will in turn greatly hurt developed economies as well,' he said. Scroll down for video . Disastrous: World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim warned Saturday that the United States was headed toward peril as politicians failed again to resolve a standoff over the budget . The alarming remarks from the Korean-American came after three days of talks revolving around meetings of the 188-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister lending agency, the World Bank, where top officials pressed the US to resolve the political impasse over the debt ceiling. The standoff has blocked approval of legislation to increase the government's borrowing limit before a fast-approaching Thursday deadline. US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has warned that he will exhaust his borrowing authority on Thursday and the government will face the prospect of defaulting on its debt unless Congress raises the $16.7 trillion borrowing limit. 'We know there are problems,' Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the head of the IMF's policy-steering committee and Singapore's finance minister, told a news conference at the end of the IMF meeting. 'We know there are near-term risks, the most obvious one being what's going on in the US with regard to the fiscal deficit.' But one of the big near-term concerns, the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will start scaling back its massive stimulus program for the economy, is actually pointing to a positive development, Tharman said. Talks: Jim Yong Kim, (left), president, World Bank Group, and Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director, talk before a meeting of the Development Committee during the World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings in Washington . It means that the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand a reduction of the stimulus. IMF officials have been forecasting that the strengthening U.S. economy will be a main driver of the global economy in the coming year. At the same time, developing country economies are slowing and their markets have been unsettled since May by anticipation that the Fed will soon begin tapering its $85-billion-a-month bond purchases, which poured cash into the economy to stimulate growth. 'The eventual normalisation of monetary policy as economies recover in the West will be a net positive for the emerging economies,' Tharman said, meaning that the strength of the major economies would help carry the global economy forward. Lew told finance ministers that the US understood the role it played as 'the anchor of the international financial system', and assured them the administration was doing all it could to reach a resolution on the debt. Stalemate: Speaker of the House John Boehner walks to his office after a meeting with fellow Republicans at the Capitol in Washington on Saturday . An effort Saturday to pass a one-year extension of the borrowing limit failed to get sufficient votes. But in a more hopeful sign, negotiations began between Democratic and Republican Senate leaders to end the impasse. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, was one of a number of officials who were guardedly confident that an eleventh-hour deal would be reached, as it has in similar standoffs in the past. 'I still think it is unthinkable that an agreement won't be found,' Draghi told reporters on Saturday. 'If this situation were to last a long time, it would be very negative for the U.S. economy and the world economy and could certainly harm the recovery.' But once Draghi moved beyond the US impasse, he sounded upbeat about the prospects for a European recovery. That in itself is a dramatic turn from the past three years, when global financial leaders were taken up with waves of crisis sweeping across the region and necessitating a series of international rescue loans. Business not as usual: President Barack Obama yesterday discussed challenges from the partial government shutdown small business owners . The IMF called on emerging economies, which have been the drivers of the global economy in recent years, to undertake reforms that will help their economies better withstand the scaling back of monetary stimulus in the U.S. and other major economies. When the stimulus money was flowing, emerging economies benefited from investments as investors were attracted by their relatively higher rates of interest vis-a-vis the United States and other major economies. But many of those same countries that benefited from capital flows have been rocked since May, as the investment flows reversed and flowed back toward the US as rates here began to rise. Alexandre Tombini, the head Brazil's central bank, told the IMF steering committee that the worries about the US and global economies might be overblown. 'A while ago there was an excess of exuberance and now perhaps an excess of pessimism,' he said. Negotiating: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada is surrounded by reporters as he leaves the Senate floor to meet with Senate Democrats regarding the government shutdown and debt ceiling . Time is ticking: Republican Senator from Kentucky Mitch McConnell walks off the Senate floor after a vote on the motion to proceed on the Debt Limit Bill . The stark warnings from the World Bank came the same day that House Speaker John Boehner today told fellow Republicans that his talks with President Barack Obama have stalled. 'The Senate needs to hold tough,' Representative Greg Walden said Boehner told House GOP lawmakers. 'The president now isn't negotiating with us.' Obama rejected the speaker's effort to lift the debt ceiling for six weeks and reopen government in exchange for a budget negotiating process. Attention now turns to the Senate, where a bipartisan group of Senators are working on a separate plan to reopen the government. New plan: Republican Senator from Maine Susan Collins leaves a Republican meeting and heads to the Senate floor to vote on the motion to proceed on the Debt Limit Bill . Word of the negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and the top Republican, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, emerged as the Senate, as expected, rejected a Democratic effort to raise the government's borrowing limit through next year. Republicans objected because they want the extension to be accompanied by spending cuts. The calendar is edging closer to the October 17 deadline to raise the federal debt ceiling. After that, administration officials have said the government will deplete its ability to borrow money, risking a first-time federal default that could jolt the world economy.",

Manchester City are the best-paid sports team in the world, with average first-team pay a whopping £5.3m a year, or £102,653 per week according to a new report that compares global earnings in the most popular leagues. Five Premier League sides make the top 20 on the list, with Liverpool - City's title showdown opponents from Sunday - in 20th place, earning an average of £3.4m per man per year. Manchester United are at No 8 on £4.3m per man per year, Champions League semi-finalists Chelsea are at No 10 (nearly £4m) and Arsenal are at No 11 (£3.9m). Scroll down to see the table of the world's highest-paid sports teams . High earners: Manchester City have topped a global sports salary list, with their squad paid £5.3m a year . Big spender: City owner Sheik Mansour has invested hundreds of millions into making them title challengers . Blank cheque: Manuel Pellegrini could sign pretty much any player in the world for City . Two giants from American baseball, the New York Yankees and the LA Dodgers, as well as the two giants of Spanish football, Real Madrid and Barcelona, fill out the top five behind City. The top 10 also includes the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA (at No 6), Bayern Munich (No 7), and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA (No 9). The Global Sports Salaries Survey (GSSS), produced for ESPN The Magazine in the USA, has been tracking comparative pay at major sports teams for five years. City players were earning an average of just under £1.5m a year each when Sheik Mansour arrived in 2008 but their pay has more than trebled in the six years of his ownership. Chelsea have also seen their wages and . fortunes soar since Roman Abramovich arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2003 . but foreign sugar-daddy ownership is not restricted to elite European . football.

Not only is Prokhorov footing the Nets' $102m (around £61m) total payroll in 2013-14, or £4.5m per player this year, but he will need to pay an additional $70m (around £42m) or thereabouts in luxury tax for exceeding the NBA's wage cap. On the list: Chelsea were 10th in the rankings with a £3.9m wage bill and still have a chance of winning the Premier League title this season . Wealth: Roman Abramovich has poured millions into Chelsea since he became owner in 2003 . Close call: Arsenal are just behind Chelsea in the survey.

      "article": "(CNN) -- Guatemala's Constitutional Court has barred the country's former first lady from running for president -- shaking up the political landscape a month before the election. The court's Monday ruling means Sandra Torres, who divorced Guatemala's current president in an attempt to circumvent a nepotism law, has now exhausted her appeals. The seven justices voted unanimously that Torres was not eligible to be on the ballot because close relatives of the president are constitutionally barred from running. Three of the judges had additional arguments for the decision. Their decision upheld a Supreme Court of Justice ruling issued last month. Torres slammed the ruling Tuesday, saying it left Guatemala's neediest citizens without anyone to represent them in the country's highest office. \"Without any legal basis, they made decisions that were political, not legal,\" she told reporters Tuesday. \"For me, it is anti-democratic, this political lynching, this lynching in the media,\" she added. Torres filed for divorce from President Alvaro Colom on March 11; the divorce was finalized in April. The country's Supreme Court ruled last month that the divorce was used to avoid the constitutional prohibition, and that in trying to get around the law, Torres committed fraud. She appealed to the Constitutional Court, which has final say in all constitutional matters. The Constitutional Court said that Torres was a close relative of the president and thus not eligible to run, but it dissented by rejecting that legal fraud had occurred. Some followers of Torres, who were gathered outside the court, cried when they heard the news. Torres said Tuesday that she had not decided whether to support another presidential candidate. She urged her followers to support congressional and mayoral candidates from the coalition of parties behind her candidacy, saying they would protect social programs. In her statement before the Constitutional Court last week, Torres accused the supreme court of having politicized justice. More than 1.7 million Guatemalans had signed a petition saying they wanted her as a candidate, she said, arguing that the people's voice should be heard. \"Democracy is built with more democracy,\" she told the judges. In her argument she reiterated that she was \"not married to anyone\" and suggested that there was discrimination against her because of her gender. Torres, 55, is a former businesswoman and clothing exporter. She was the candidate of the coalition of the National Unity for Hope Party (UNE) and the Grand National Alliance (GANA). The end to her candidacy could boost the presidential aspirations of the front-runner, retired Gen. Otto Perez Molina of the Patriotic Party. According to a Prodatos poll released in late July, 37.6% of those surveyed said they would vote for Perez Molina in the September 11 elections. Torres came in second with 17.2% of the vote. The poll also asked who they would vote for if Torres' candidacy was rejected. With Torres out, Perez Molina's numbers rose to 41.2%, and former congressman Manuel Baldizon, of the Democratic Renovated Liberty Party (Lider), was a distant second with 13.6%.",

      "article": "Washington (CNN) -- Fire-protection systems on freight aircraft are inadequate, top U.S. aviation investigators say. The National Transportation Safety Board recommended improvements and rule changes Wednesday based on investigations of three catastrophic cargo plane fires. NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration require better early detection of fires inside cargo containers, development of fire-resistant containers and requiring active fire-suppression systems on all freight airlines. An NTSB report focused on three cargo fire accidents since 2006. Two of those fires killed the flight crews and destroyed the aircraft, in incidents in Dubai and North Korea. In the third incident in Philadelphia, the crew escaped with minor smoke-inhalation difficulties, and the plane was significantly damaged. \"These fires quickly grew out of control, leaving the crew with little time to get the aircraft on the ground,\" Hersman said in a statement released with the report. \"Detection, suppression and containment systems can give crews more time and more options. The current approach is not safe enough.\" FAA budget cuts would affect fliers . In all three cases, the fires started within the cargo containers aboard the planes, but by the time the plane's fire warning system alerted pilots to the dangers, there was little time for them to react. Federal regulations require cargo airline fire detection systems to alert pilots within one minute of a fire starting, but the NTSB's investigation found current systems detected fire and smoke anywhere from two and half minutes to more than 18 minutes after the fire started. The NTSB concluded cargo containers made of flammable materials significantly increase the intensity of the on-board fires because there's been little focus by manufacturers or regulators to develop fire-resistant cargo containers. Additionally, the NTSB's report recommended improved fire suppression systems on cargo planes, a recommendation it originally made to the FAA in 2007. After the 2007 recommendation, the FAA did a cost-benefit analysis of upgrading fire suppression systems and found it to be too expensive, a fact the NTSB highlighted in its report. \"The two catastrophic cargo airplane fires that occurred in less than a year occurred after the FAA's cost-benefit analysis concluded that the installation of fire suppression systems was not cost-effective,\" the board said. UPS briefed Hersman earlier this week on the shipping company's efforts to develop improved fire safety standards. Also, FedEx is in the process of installing a fire suppression system on its long-haul fleet, the NTSB said. In an e-mail statement to CNN, FAA officials said the agency \"has long supported improved fire protection on all cargo airplanes through research on new, non-Halon fire extinguishing agents, fire suppression systems directed at individual cargo containers or specific cargo compartment zones, and advanced cargo containers incorporating smoke detection, fire containment, and/or fire suppression systems.\" FAA officials said they would carefully evaluate the NTSB's recommendations.

Ernst Berlin came up with the idea for the unique gift after discovering a community of artists on the website Reddit. Determined to give his wife, Agnes, something special, Ernst contacted between 45 and 50 artists who had some of the most successful submissions on the site. Scroll down for video . Ernst Berlin (pictured with his nine-month-old son Jacob), from Chicago, has given his wife Agnes a birthday present she will never forget - after commissioning 23 artists to create unique works of art of his family . The artworks were each based on various photographs of the family supplied to the 23 artists for inspiration . Mr Berlin, 33, asked 50 artists to paint a picture of his son Jacob (above) and was pleased that 23 responded . Mr Berlin filmed his wife's reaction to the works - created by a range of artists - and posted the video online . Baby Bond: The images came in over a period months - and Mr Berlin liked them all, so he hung them all up . To his surprise, 23 artists replied. Ernst, whose nine-month-old son Jacob would also feature in the pictures, said he liked all of their works so much he couldn't turn them down. As an amateur photographer, Ernst, 33, decided to send the artists a selection of 40 pictures of his family, allowing them to choose which they would like to work with. Over a period of a few months, the images kept coming in. When her birthday came around, Ernst treated Agnes, now 34, to a three-hour-long spa treatment - allowing him to hang the works on the wall while she was out. Agnes' reaction was one of shock, with Ernst filming her response and later putting it on YouTube for friends and family to see. Mr Berlin, an amateur photographer, found the artists on website Reddit, and after initially asking the group if anyone was interested, was surprised when submissions kept coming in over a period of several months . Mr Berlin's nine-month-old son Jacob became the star of the show - and featured in the majority of the pieces . The artists chose from 40 pictures altogether, such as this cute image of Jacob resting on his mother's belly . After receiving the final artworks back from the artists, Mr Berlin hung them around the house for his wife . Mr Berlin, 33, said: 'I was worried about not finishing it in time, but luckily it all worked out' One of the artists chose to recreate this picture of Agnes and Jacob in hospital just after he was born . Mr Berlin sent a selection of adorable pictures to the artists, including this one of nine-month-old Jacob . He then waited over a period of several months for the artists' own creations to be returned to him . Jacob features in the majority of the artworks, which were given to his surprised mother on her birthday . Mr Berlin said the response to his idea from his family and friends has been overwhelmingly positive . The idea to approach the artists was a 'light bulb moment', according to Mr Berlin. Pictured: A photograph of young Jacob (left) and a replica artwork supplied by one of the artists which Mr Berlin found on Reddit . Mr Berlin, his wife Agnes and their son Jacob could be seen having fun in a park in one of the photographs . The same photograph was transformed by one of the artists on Reddit (above) and returned to the family .

      "article": "There has been a great deal spoken about the sweltering heat and humidity England will face in Manaus when they play Italy on Saturday night. But how does it actually feel to run and exercise in such testing conditions? With the help of a Battersea Park biodome, an industrial-sized heater and a treadmill, Adam Shergold found out. It takes less than 10 seconds for the first bead of sweat to start trickling its way down from my forehead, off the tip of my nose and on to my soon-to-be-saturated shirt. It's a little disheartening for someone who considers themselves fairly fit, and is currently in training for a half-marathon, to be perspiring so uncontrollably after just a minute or so of exercise. Feeling the heat: Sportsmail's Adam Shergold gets going on the treadmill inside a biodome that replicates the hot and humid conditions England will experience when they face Italy in Manaus on Saturday night . Ramp it up: As our man reaches full speed on the treadmill, the 30C heat and 80 per cent humidity starts to take its toll . Venue: The Arena da Amazonia will host England's first World Cup match, against Italy on Saturday evening . Ready, boys? England have been gradually acclimatising to the hot conditions in Brazil . But then the sweltering conditions of Manaus have no mercy on anyone, not even the super-fit elite footballers who will play there during the World Cup. I'm running on a treadmill in a Biodome set up by Ladbrokes in Battersea Park to replicate the extreme conditions England will encounter when they step out to play Italy at the Arena Amazonia on Saturday week. Outside, the late Spring day is grey and drizzly but this 'Mini-Manaus' feels like a pressure-cooker as industrial-sized heaters relentlessly circulate chokingly hot air. The hard yards: Shergold winds down after running for 10 minutes in the 'Mini-Manaus' biodome built by Ladbrokes in Battersea Park . Welcome refreshment: The cold water is very much necessary after completing the 'Mini-Manaus' challenge . The thermometer reads 31C, the average temperature in Manaus at this time of year, and the humidity sits just above the 80 per cent mark. These are conditions in which even walking down the street is an effort, so playing 90 minutes of high-intensity football is not an attractive option. I manage about 10 minutes of running on the treadmill, working up from a walk to an all-out sprint, before the temptation to throw water all over myself becomes too great. Each match at the World Cup will factor in drinks breaks, and these will be absolutely essential for the players to take on water or an energy drink and rehydrate. Warmer climes: A game of football being played on the beach in Manaus . Flavour of the Amazon: Shergold outside the heated biodome built in Battersea Park to replicate the sweltering, tropical conditions in Manaus . The paramedic on standby at the Biodome measures my core body temperature at a normal 37.2C before stepping on the treadmill. At the end, it's nudging above 38C, the kind of level when you're suffering from a fever. It's a relief to step outside the dome again, into the cooling London drizzle, and I have plenty of sympathy for the England players who will have to cope with these energy-sapping conditions while carrying the weight of the nation's expectation.

Ramp it up: As our man reaches full speed on the treadmill, the 30C heat and 80 per cent humidity starts to take its toll . Venue: The Arena da Amazonia will host England's first World Cup match, against Italy on Saturday evening . Ready, boys? England have been gradually acclimatising to the hot conditions in Brazil . But then the sweltering conditions of Manaus have no mercy on anyone, not even the super-fit elite footballers who will play there during the World Cup. I'm running on a treadmill in a Biodome set up by Ladbrokes in Battersea Park to replicate the extreme conditions England will encounter when they step out to play Italy at the Arena Amazonia on Saturday week. Outside, the late Spring day is grey and drizzly but this 'Mini-Manaus' feels like a pressure-cooker as industrial-sized heaters relentlessly circulate chokingly hot air. The hard yards: Shergold winds down after running for 10 minutes in the 'Mini-Manaus' biodome built by Ladbrokes in Battersea Park . Welcome refreshment: The cold water is very much necessary after completing the 'Mini-Manaus' challenge . The thermometer reads 31C, the average temperature in Manaus at this time of year, and the humidity sits just above the 80 per cent mark. These are conditions in which even walking down the street is an effort, so playing 90 minutes of high-intensity football is not an attractive option. I manage about 10 minutes of running on the treadmill, working up from a walk to an all-out sprint, before the temptation to throw water all over myself becomes too great. Each match at the World Cup will factor in drinks breaks, and these will be absolutely essential for the players to take on water or an energy drink and rehydrate. Warmer climes: A game of football being played on the beach in Manaus . Flavour of the Amazon: Shergold outside the heated biodome built in Battersea Park to replicate the sweltering, tropical conditions in Manaus . The paramedic on standby at the Biodome measures my core body temperature at a normal 37.2C before stepping on the treadmill. At the end, it's nudging above 38C, the kind of level when you're suffering from a fever. It's a relief to step outside the dome again, into the cooling London drizzle, and I have plenty of sympathy for the England players who will have to cope with these energy-sapping conditions while carrying the weight of the nation's expectation.

      "article": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A pressurized cylinder exploded at Universal Studios on Sunday, injuring two firefighters as they tried to fight a blaze that began earlier in the day, Los Angeles authorities said. The fire destroyed buildings and movie sets at Universal Studios on Sunday. Eight other firefighters were injured in the fire, which was expected to be contained by 4:15 p.m. (7:15 p.m. ET), said Ron Haralson, an inspector with the Los Angeles County Fire Department. The explosion occurred about 2:30 p.m. (5:30 p.m. ET) near the video vault of the Universal Studios back lot. The vault was damaged. The fast-moving, early morning blaze destroyed several movie sets and the King Kong exhibit. Even so, officials still planned to go ahead with the 2008 MTV Movie Awards show at the site -- just north of downtown Los Angeles, adjacent to the Universal Studios theme park. \"The areas we are utilizing for our production were unaffected and the 2008 MTV Movie Awards will go on as planned. We're working closely with authorities to make sure everything operates smoothly,\" an MTV spokesman said in a statement. The awards show will bring a parade of A-list stars to the park's CityWalk area. According to MTV's Web site, celebrities such as Tom Cruise, Will Smith, Sarah Jessica Parker, Justin Timberlake and Robert Downey Jr. likely will attend. Universal Studios officials planned to resume normal business hours Monday, including the studio tour. The fire destroyed an area called New York street, which includes movie set-style buildings designed to look like the cityscape of New York City. Hours after the blaze was reported, the roughly two-block area appeared charred and resembled a \"disaster movie,\" said Los Angeles Councilman Tom LaBonge.

Another area called \"Courthouse Square\" also was destroyed, Meyer said. Numerous movies have been shot in that area, including several scenes of the 1985 hit \"Back to the Future,\" Meyer said.

      "article": "Police chiefs have handed Leeds United more than £1.2 million after the High Court ruled that the Championship football club had been overcharged for policing at home games, a judge has heard. But Leeds' bosses claim that they are still owed more than £800,000, Sir David Eady was told. The figures emerged on Friday after the judge examined the latest stage of the dispute between West Yorkshire Police and Leeds. Overharged: West Yorkshire Police have been ordered to pay Leeds £1.2m . Two years ago Eady ruled that the force overcharged for 'special police services' over three seasons between 2009 and 2012, following a High Court hearing. West Yorkshire Police and Leeds are now arguing over how exactly much should be repaid. The judge on Friday revealed detail of developments in the case in a written analysis following a further High Court hearing in London in June. 'In July 2012, I ruled that Leeds United Football Club had been charged for special police services over the three preceding football seasons, in respect of home matches, on a basis that was in part unlawful,' Eady said. 'It thus became necessary to find a methodology by which to calculate the appropriate rebate. It did not prove possible for the parties to agree a formula. Each ... proposed a distinct methodology.'

The judge said the force had 'repaid the rebate it thought due' and 'claims now that no more is owed'.

These missions will continue this week. The government has yet to give the final go-ahead for air attacks to start. It hasn't said yet whether IS would be targeted in Syria as well as Iraq. Defence chief Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said Australia was planning and coordinating operations of the Air Task Group with international partners. He said this task group, which comprises six Super Hornets plus the Wedgetail and KC-30A was well-suited to operating with coalition aircraft.

Investigators dropped the charge because they say the suspect, Kevin Edson, 25, did not communicate an \"overt threat that an incendiary device would be detonated,\" Jake Wark, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district attorney, told CNN. Edson was arrested after carrying the backpack with a rice cooker near the finish line on Boylston Street in Boston while survivors of the 2013 bombing were commemorating its anniversary on April 15.

Edson still faces charges of disturbing the peace, disorderly conduct, disturbing a public assembly and possession or use of a hoax device. His next court date is scheduled for August 27.

      "article": "COLUMBIA, South Carolina (CNN) -- The United States faces a Zimbabwe-style economic collapse if it keeps \"spending a bunch of money we don't have,\" South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford said Wednesday. South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford says he does not want to spend money that his state doesn't have. Sanford, a Republican, has been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration's $800 billion stimulus plan. He said he'll turn down about a quarter of his state's $2.8 billion share unless Washington lets him use that money to pay down debt. \"What you're doing is buying into the notion that if we just print some more money that we don't have and send it to different states, we'll create jobs,\" he said. \"If that's the case, why isn't Zimbabwe a rich place?\" Zimbabwe has been in the throes of an economic meltdown ever since the southern African nation embarked on a chaotic land reform program. Its official inflation rate topped 11 million percent in 2008, with its treasury printing banknotes in the trillion-dollar range to keep up with the plummeting value of its currency. But with South Carolina's unemployment rate now the second-highest in the country, state lawmakers will attempt to override Sanford and take the $700 million if he turns it down, Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer said. \"They will use the total economic stimulus to stimulate the economy, jump-start it, so we can get out of the ditch we are in as a state and as a nation,\" Bauer, a fellow Republican, said in a written statement Wednesday. Labor Department figures released Wednesday showed South Carolina's January unemployment rate hit 10.4 percent, second only to Michigan's 11.6 percent. Sanford is one of several Republican governors who have criticized the nearly $800 billion stimulus package, which passed with minimal GOP support in the Senate and none in the House of Representatives. Other governors, such as California Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger or Michigan Democrat Jennifer Granholm, have said they would take any money Republican-led states reject. But Sanford told reporters that taking the money now would leave the state in the lurch in two years, \"when those funds dry up.\" \"Fundamentally, if you boil down what the stimulus means for South Carolina, it means we would go through the process of spending a bunch of money we don't have,\" he said. The stimulus measure allows state legislatures to override governors and take the money -- a provision championed by South Carolina congressman James Clyburn, the No. 3 Democrat in the House. Clyburn said Sanford is unlikely to get any waiver from the administration, and he called the governor's announcement \"100 percent political posturing.\" \"This recovery package is designed to stabilize communities, to save and create jobs, and help our economy get back in a growth mode,\" he told reporters. \"And you don't do that by paying down debt that's been incurred over a long period of time.\" And Bauer said that if South Carolina turns down the money, \"South Carolina taxpayers will be taking on the debt for economic stimulus money sent elsewhere.\" Sanford has been called a potential GOP presidential contender in 2012, but he told CNN that the next election is \"not where I'm focused.\" \"I don't rule anything in, I don't rule anything out,\" he said, adding, \"If anything came along like that, it would be an incredibly long shot.\"",

      "article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Nearly 6.2 million students in the United States between the ages of 16 and 24 in 2007 dropped out of high school, fueling what a report released Tuesday called \"a persistent high school dropout crisis.\" A new report on high school dropouts in the United States calls for a national re-enrollment strategy. The total represents 16 percent of all people in the United States in that age range in 2007. Most of the dropouts were Latino or black, according to a report by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, and the Alternative Schools Network in Chicago, Illinois. \"Because of the widespread, pressing nature of the crisis and the large numbers of young people who have already dropped out, a national re-enrollment strategy should be a fundamental part of America's national education agenda,\" the report says. However, the report notes, the \"absence of new funding at the federal and state level since the 1980s has led to decades of disinvestment in re-enrollment programs across the country.\" Despite the funding cutbacks, there have been re-enrollment successes nationally and in a number of cities including Chicago; Los Angeles, California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Portland, Oregon, the report says. \"These programs have found that young people who have left high school before earning a diploma are not dead-end dropouts, but often are in fact students waiting and looking for opportunities to re-enroll and finish high school,\" the study says. \"The most successful programs are small (80-150 students), offering comprehensive after-school and summer activities, led by experienced principals and teachers, focused on learning in the real world, well-funded with local school site program and fiscal control, and track specific, measurable outcomes for student achievement including skill gains, enrollment, attendance, credit gains, promotions and graduations.\" Jesse Williams, 22, was one of those dropouts who is now working on her degree.

The total represents 16 percent of all people in the United States in that age range in 2007. Most of the dropouts were Latino or black, according to a report by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts, and the Alternative Schools Network in Chicago, Illinois. \"Because of the widespread, pressing nature of the crisis and the large numbers of young people who have already dropped out, a national re-enrollment strategy should be a fundamental part of America's national education agenda,\" the report says. However, the report notes, the \"absence of new funding at the federal and state level since the 1980s has led to decades of disinvestment in re-enrollment programs across the country.\" Despite the funding cutbacks, there have been re-enrollment successes nationally and in a number of cities including Chicago; Los Angeles, California; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Portland, Oregon, the report says. \"These programs have found that young people who have left high school before earning a diploma are not dead-end dropouts, but often are in fact students waiting and looking for opportunities to re-enroll and finish high school,\" the study says. \"The most successful programs are small (80-150 students), offering comprehensive after-school and summer activities, led by experienced principals and teachers, focused on learning in the real world, well-funded with local school site program and fiscal control, and track specific, measurable outcomes for student achievement including skill gains, enrollment, attendance, credit gains, promotions and graduations.\" Jesse Williams, 22, was one of those dropouts who is now working on her degree.

A top independent school in Scotland is offering parents a mortgage-style payment scheme for their child's school fees. In a move to make private education more affordable, the Fernhill School in Glasgow has offered parents the chance to spread the cost of fees over ten years, interest free. Tony Boswell, a governor of the Catholic school, which charges £8976 a year for a senior school day pupil, said the new payment plan, thought to be the first of its kind in Scotland, could reduce monthly payments by up to 50 per cent. 'Innovative': Under the Fernhill scheme, parents can pay half the school fees every year and repay the outstanding amount after their child has left . He said: ‚öÑ≤We recognise that times are tough and we have been striving to develop a solution that helps families who may otherwise be unable to afford an independent education. ‚öÑ≤Fernhill's payment plan will be launched for the 2013/14 school year and allow parents whose children are joining this year to spread the cost of their fees over a longer term. ‚öÑ≤There is high demand from prospective parents for this kind of payment plan and, as this recession lengthens, we believe it is the right thing to do to ease the financial burden on those who want a private education.' The average cost of private education is now more than £12,000 a year, with fees rising faster than the rate of inflation. Money troubles: The increase in school fees has put pressure on parents . The price of sending a child to an independent school in Scotland rose by 3.5 per cent in 2012/13 - with the highest fees topping £21,000. The increases put pressure on parents - particularly those for whom private education is at the limits of affordability. In February, the consumer price index, the Government's preferred measure of inflation, was running at 2.7 per cent, while the retail price index rose to 3.3 per cent in January. A report by the Bank of Scotland - published before the impact of the credit crunch - warned that members of key Scottish professions were already being priced out of sending their children to fee-paying schools, with teachers, engineers and police officers no longer able to afford a private education. More recently, the number of children attending private school in Scotland has fallen, with a drop of 1.5 per cent in both nursery and primary between 2010/11 and 2011/12. Under the Fernhill scheme, parents can pay half the school fees every year rather than the full amount and continue to repay the outstanding sums once their child has left. Other financial schemes available to parents in the sector include savings plans where money can be built up in advance of paying fees. In England, a number of finance companies offer to pay the fees in advance with parents repaying over a longer period time plus additional interest.

Eight out ten babies are born to couples living together, but that figure falls to just 55 per cent as they grow up. The figures were released as Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith announced plans to pay private firms and charities to help keep Britain's 120,000 problem families together.

He said the Government would change the way it measures the success of social programmes for the poor, to make preventing the breakdown of family life the key yardstick. Rather than simply recording how much money is thrown at the schemes, officials will have to log how they promote family stability, combat worklessness and whether children in the families affected perform as well their peers in other families. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith used a speech today to say the government would intervene to stop parents splitting up .

Those are the questions bloggers and Twitter users are batting around the Internet on Monday following a news report saying Facebook is looking into ways it could let kids under the age of 13 use the site with parental consent. Currently, Facebook bans children younger than 13. Data from Microsoft Research and Consumer Reports, however, show that many kids use the site anyway, often with their parents' knowledge. A 2011 Consumer Reports survey found 7.5 million people younger than 13 use the site; nearly a third of 11-year-olds and more than half of 12-year-olds use Facebook with their parents' knowledge, according to a 1,007-person survey supported by Microsoft Research. Proponents of lifting Facebook's under-13 ban say letting young kids on Facebook with the help of adults would allow them to use the social network more safely. \"Whether we like it or not, millions of children are using Facebook, and since there doesn't seem to be a universally effective way to get them off the service, the best and safest strategy would be to provide younger children with a safe, secure and private experience that allows them to interact with verified friends and family members without having to lie about their age,\" Larry Magid writes at Forbes.com. Magid says Facebook for kids should not have ads and there need to be \"extra privacy protections\" that would involve parents helping their kids to use the social network safely. Others say Facebook is trying to profit from the under-13 crowd. Common Sense Media, an advocacy group, compared Facebook to \"Big Tobacco.\" Poll: Should kids younger than 13 be allowed to use Facebook? \"With the growing concerns and pressure around Facebook's business model, the company appears to be doing whatever it takes to identify new revenue streams and short-term corporate profits to impress spooked shareholders,\" the group's CEO, James Steyer, said in a statement. \"But here's the most important issue: There is absolutely no proof of any meaningful social or educational value of Facebook for children under 13. Indeed, there are very legitimate concerns about privacy as well as the impact on the social, emotional and cognitive development of children. What Facebook is proposing is similar to the strategies used by Big Tobacco in appealing to young people -- try to hook kids early, build your brand, and you have a customer for life. \"What's next? Facebook for toddlers?\" The Wall Street Journal on Monday published a front-page report saying Facebook is looking into ways to give younger children access to the social-networking site, which has more than 900 million users around the world and which made its lackluster stock market debut last month. \"Mechanisms being tested include connecting children's accounts to their parents' and controls that would allow parents to decide whom their kids can 'friend' and what applications they can use,\" the newspaper said, citing anonymous sources who are familiar with the dealings. \"The under-13 features could enable Facebook and its partners to charge parents for games and other entertainment accessed by their children, the people said.\" In a statement issued to CNN and other news outlets, Facebook did not deny looking into the issue but said it does not have anything formal to announce: . \"Many recent reports have highlighted just how difficult it is to enforce age restrictions on the Internet, especially when parents want their children to access online content and services.

Nasa scientists analyzing data from the Cassini mission say the have firm evidence the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts. They say the density of the oceans mean they are are salty as the Dead Sea. Researchers found that Titan's ice shell, which overlies a very salty ocean, varies in thickness around the moon, suggesting the crust is in the process of becoming rigid.

Using the Cassini data, researchers presented a model structure for Titan, resulting in an improved understanding of the structure of the moon's outer ice shell. Researchers found that a relatively high density was required for Titan's ocean in order to explain the gravity data. This indicates the ocean is probably an extremely salty brine of water mixed with dissolved salts likely composed of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The density indicated for this brine would give the ocean a salt content roughly equal to the saltiest bodies of water on Earth. It is believed the ocean is made of sulfur, sodium and potassium. The new results come from a study of gravity and topography data collected during Cassini's repeated flybys of Titan during the past 10 years. Using the Cassini data, researchers presented a model structure for Titan, resulting in an improved understanding of the structure of the moon's outer ice shell. The findings are published in this week's edition of the journal Icarus. 'Titan continues to prove itself as an endlessly fascinating world, and with our long-lived Cassini spacecraft, we're unlocking new mysteries as fast as we solve old ones,' said Linda Spilker, Cassini project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who was not involved in the study. The salt content allows the bathers to read while floating effortlessly in the Dead Sea, Jordan Valley. Experts say the underground ocean on Titan would be similar.

      "article": "(CNN) -- Former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo appeared in a New York court Tuesday and pleaded not guilty to charges that he laundered $70 million through U.S. banks while in power. Portillo, who was extradited to the United States last week, has always denied the charges against him and says the accusations are based on the lies of political enemies. \"This is a case of clear overreaching by the Department of Justice and the United States government against former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo, who is innocent of all the charges against him,\" defense attorney David M. Rosenfield told reporters on Tuesday. \"Former President Portillo was tried on many of these same charges in a politically motivated criminal case in Guatemala in early 2011, and was acquitted on all charges. The acquittal was upheld on appeal,\" he said. \"Former President Portillo intends to vigorously defend himself against the current charges against him and fully expects to be acquitted here just as he was acquitted in Guatemala.\" U.S. prosecutors have said Portillo, who led the Central American country from 2000 to 2004, used his authority to launder and misappropriate millions of dollars. \"Portillo is charged with converting the office of the Guatemalan presidency into his personal ATM,\" Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, said in a 2010 statement. \"Through various alleged embezzlement schemes, including one which involved $1.5 million intended for Guatemalan school children, Portillo abused the trust of his nation's people.\" An indictment unsealed in New York federal court accuses Portillo of embezzling tens of millions of dollars worth of public funds, \"a substantial portion of which he laundered through American and European bank accounts.\" After the United States made an extradition request, Guatemalan authorities arrested him on a farm on the country's coast in 2010. Guatemalan courts and the country's president authorized his extradition to the United States in 2011, but the transfer did not happen until Friday. In court Tuesday, Portillo wore a gray suit and a maroon tie. He had a pair of headphones for translation. His attorneys have asked for a bail hearing within two weeks. Portillo has said that he never laundered money in U.S. banks. \"In the United States, it is a revenge of the richest group of the American right,\" he said in an interview with CNN en Espa‚àöâ±ol in January. \"They are charging me for being the only president who did not support, with his signature nor with his permission, the invasion in Iraq.\" \"If deposits were made,\" he said, \"they are deposits that first of all come from institutions that are not illicit. In order for there to be laundering, the first requirement is that the money is from an illegal origin or comes from an illegal activity.\" Portillo responded directly to the charge concerning the $1.5 million that the United States says was intended for schoolchildren. That money, Portillo said, was something he had requested and received before he became president. From the beginning, that money was raised to create a trust fund to support his daughter's studies, and that's what it was used for, Portillo said. Despite his claims that his rights have been violated during the extradition process, Portillo said he believes he will get a fair trial in the United States. \"I have confidence that at least I will have a transparent, impartial, objective trial that is based on reliable evidence and not just testimonies that are based on falsehoods,\" he said.

Rosenfield told reporters on Tuesday. \"Former President Portillo was tried on many of these same charges in a politically motivated criminal case in Guatemala in early 2011, and was acquitted on all charges. The acquittal was upheld on appeal,\" he said. \"Former President Portillo intends to vigorously defend himself against the current charges against him and fully expects to be acquitted here just as he was acquitted in Guatemala.\" U.S. prosecutors have said Portillo, who led the Central American country from 2000 to 2004, used his authority to launder and misappropriate millions of dollars. \"Portillo is charged with converting the office of the Guatemalan presidency into his personal ATM,\" Preet Bharara, U.S. attorney for the southern district of New York, said in a 2010 statement. \"Through various alleged embezzlement schemes, including one which involved $1.5 million intended for Guatemalan school children, Portillo abused the trust of his nation's people.\" An indictment unsealed in New York federal court accuses Portillo of embezzling tens of millions of dollars worth of public funds, \"a substantial portion of which he laundered through American and European bank accounts.\" After the United States made an extradition request, Guatemalan authorities arrested him on a farm on the country's coast in 2010. Guatemalan courts and the country's president authorized his extradition to the United States in 2011, but the transfer did not happen until Friday. In court Tuesday, Portillo wore a gray suit and a maroon tie. He had a pair of headphones for translation. His attorneys have asked for a bail hearing within two weeks. Portillo has said that he never laundered money in U.S. banks. \"In the United States, it is a revenge of the richest group of the American right,\" he said in an interview with CNN en Espa‚àöâ±ol in January. \"They are charging me for being the only president who did not support, with his signature nor with his permission, the invasion in Iraq.\" \"If deposits were made,\" he said, \"they are deposits that first of all come from institutions that are not illicit. In order for there to be laundering, the first requirement is that the money is from an illegal origin or comes from an illegal activity.\" Portillo responded directly to the charge concerning the $1.5 million that the United States says was intended for schoolchildren. That money, Portillo said, was something he had requested and received before he became president. From the beginning, that money was raised to create a trust fund to support his daughter's studies, and that's what it was used for, Portillo said. Despite his claims that his rights have been violated during the extradition process, Portillo said he believes he will get a fair trial in the United States. \"I have confidence that at least I will have a transparent, impartial, objective trial that is based on reliable evidence and not just testimonies that are based on falsehoods,\" he said. A fair trial would not be possible in Guatemala, he added. Twist in Guatemalan case: Genocide conviction overturned . Guatemala confronts a dark chapter .

      "article": "A film dramatizing the death of Osama bin Laden is set to debut next month two days before the U.S. presidential election. The movie produced by the production company of movie mogul Harvey Weinstein will air on November 4 before President Barack Obama faces Republican challenger Mitt Romney at the polls just two days later. Weinstein is a prominent fundraiser for Obama's re-election campaign, which has touted bin Laden's death as an example of the president's leadership. Scroll down for video . Before polls: The film dramatizing Osama bin Laden's death will air two days before President Obama faces Republican challenger Mitt Romney at the polls (pictured together at the presidential debate on Wednesday) The timing of the film's broadcast prompted suggestions that it was deliberately intended to show the president in a good light two days before the polls. Seal Team Six: The Raid On Osama bin Laden from The Weinstein Co. and Voltage Pictures will air on the National Geographic Channel. National Geographic Channel chose the film's debut date to help promote the start of its fall season, channel President Howard T. Owens said yesterday. He insisted the timing was not motivated by politics, adding: ‚öÑ≤Harvey obviously doesn't schedule our network. Dramatizing terrorist's death: Movie mogul and Obama supporter Harvey Weinstein (left) has produced the movie about the death of Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden (right) who was killed in a raid on his compound in Pakistan in 2011 . Leading moment: Bin Laden's death has been touted as a strong show of Obama's leadership (pictured with Secretary of State Hilary Clinton and national security staff as they receive an update on the mission in 2011) Mr Owens added that the channel is ‚öÑ≤not political. We are opportunistic from a programming perspective.' National Geographic Channel also took into account Weinstein's desire to get out ahead of a movie about the U.S. Navy SEALs' hunt for the al-Qaida leader to be released in theatres at the end of the year, Mr Owens said. The competition comes from film 'Zero Dark Thirty' from director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, who won six Oscars for the acclaimed 'The Hurt Locker' which follows a team of army bomb disposal experts in Iraq as they battle to carry out their jobs in extremely testing circumstances. Remnants of raid: The foundations of bin Laden's compound were left destroyed after the raid by U.S. commandoes in Abbottabad, Pakistan . Carnage: A U.S. military helicopter was destroyed in the raid (the wreckage pictured outside bin Laden's compound) 'Seal Team Six,' directed by John . Stockwell (Into the Blue), was also intended for a big-screen release . until the channel made what it called a ‚öÑ≤pre-emptive bid' for it. The . film will be available to Netflix U.S. subscribers a day after its . premiere. The depiction of . the bin Laden raid in Pakistan was vetted by experts that included a . recently retired Navy SEAL and a bin Laden historian, the channel said. A . news release from the channel said: ‚öÑ≤While some aspects of the . characterizations have been dramatized for creative reasons, the core . story is an accurate portrayal of an event that ended the longest . manhunt in American history.' Competition: Weinstein's film will air ahead of a film on the same events directed by Kathryn Bigelow (left), who directed the Oscar-winning film 'The Hurt Locker' (right Jeremy Renner in the film) about an army bomb disposal team in Iraq .",

Seal Team Six: The Raid On Osama bin Laden from The Weinstein Co. and Voltage Pictures will air on the National Geographic Channel.

He insisted the timing was not motivated by politics, adding: ‚öÑ≤Harvey obviously doesn't schedule our network. Dramatizing terrorist's death: Movie mogul and Obama supporter Harvey Weinstein (left) has produced the movie about the death of Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden (right) who was killed in a raid on his compound in Pakistan in 2011 .

National Geographic Channel also took into account Weinstein's desire to get out ahead of a movie about the U.S. Navy SEALs' hunt for the al-Qaida leader to be released in theatres at the end of the year, Mr Owens said. The competition comes from film 'Zero Dark Thirty' from director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal, who won six Oscars for the acclaimed 'The Hurt Locker' which follows a team of army bomb disposal experts in Iraq as they battle to carry out their jobs in extremely testing circumstances. Remnants of raid: The foundations of bin Laden's compound were left destroyed after the raid by U.S. commandoes in Abbottabad, Pakistan .

      "article": "(CNN) -- As thousands of aviation geeks, (oops, sorry, \"enthusiasts\"), hang out at this week's giant AirVenture airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, the folks at Disney brought a gift: a sneak preview Friday night of the movie \"Planes.\" This is Hollywood's answer to the wildly successful animated film \"Cars.\" \"Planes\" aims to celebrate the same passion for travel across skyways that \"Cars\" did for highways. Obviously, it's a safe bet many avgeeks will like it -- it's about planes! But are they gonna respect it? Although aviation enthusiasts tend to appreciate authenticity, attention to detail and accuracy, let's remind ourselves that this is a fantasy movie about planes that talk. With that in mind, when it comes to the aircraft, does the movie bear any resemblance to reality? Well, yes, according to Sean Bautista, a veteran pilot who consulted on the film. Bautista, who has flown planes ranging from small Cessnas to fighter jets to Boeing 747 airliners, spoke with CNN from his home in California's central San Joaquin Valley about his work on \"Planes,\" and he pulled back the curtain to reveal a few behind-the-scenes details. CNN: What does this film offer adult aviation enthusiasts? What can they look forward to? Sean Bautista: At a screening for aviation enthusiasts I went to, the general comments were that, in the air, it was probably the most accurate aviation movie they've seen. That includes animated and non-animated movies. But as you watch the movie after a while, I forgot they were airplanes. You get so into the story. Of course, it's not completely realistic. One thing they did with the movie that's really unique: On the ground, the airplanes are characters. ... But in the air, with John Lasseter executive producing and Klay Hall directing -- they really pushed for accuracy. These have to be airplanes. They have to fly like airplanes. They have to move like airplanes. We can't have them go faster than they would in real life compared to other airplanes. So they really did a good job of holding true to the aviation world. They really did go to great pains -- even down to the dialogue, the radio transmissions and everything -- to keep it as accurate as they could. CNN: Spill the beans: What inaccuracies did you notice? And what did the filmmakers change because of your comments? Bautista: Early on (in the production), I was spending hours watching reels. I would have page after page of comments. I looked at everything, from toys to artwork to script to story to dialogue, everything. I would (point out things that were inaccurate), and it would start affecting the story. And when that happens, everybody including Klay Hall and the writers gets involved in it. For example, Dusty is a crop duster who dreams about being a racer. The problem is: A crop duster is slow by design. So Dusty is physically limited, and he's going to be racing against planes that can go four times his speed. So how do you get around that? It was challenging. I'd say, 'Well, first you've got to get rid of the spray boom on the bottom (of the plane).' There's so much drag from that. In the movie, they treated that almost like a vasectomy. He doesn't want to lose valuable body parts. And I thought that was a pretty hilarious way that they did it. He needed to reduce drag, increase power -- and I don't want to give away too much -- but there was a lot they had to work around. At one point (the filmmakers said), 'OK, (Dusty's) racing an airliner ... to train himself.' And I'm like, 'That particular airliner he will never, ever, ever be able to catch. You need to change that airliner to a commuter turbo prop pulling in the opposite direction so it's eating headwinds ... Mostly, my inputs came in the military flying and the airliner stuff. And then looking at controls and things. I remember there's a scene where a big race starts, and they're starting their engines, and I had them freeze it, and I watched it back again. I told them that Chu -- one of the main characters -- his propeller is turning backwards. They said, \"What do you mean it's turning backwards?\" I said, \"Well, either his engine is rotating in the wrong direction, or his propeller -- the way it's built on him right now, he will go backwards.\" And then they had me look, start looking at all the airplanes. And sure enough, I said \"that one would spin circles, because one engine was spinning backwards; one was spinning forwards.\" Things like that. They didn't know or understand the relationship between rotation direction and pitch of the propeller. So there are things in the story that were driven by input that I made, where things like that got changed. As an aviation geek, you're going to find very little wrong with this movie. CNN: What actual aircraft are represented in this movie? Or are these characters just amalgamations of planes that might look familiar to us but are not actual aircraft that we might see in real life? Bautista: Some of them are amalgamations. Dusty is an amalgamation of three different types of crop dusters. Some of them are very close to the real thing. Skipper is an F4U Corsair. There are P-51 Mustangs in the movie. But a lot of the planes, especially the more modern airplanes like airliners and things like that, are what I call \"esque.\" They're very 747-esque. Or Airbus A380-esque. The Navy airplanes are very F-18-esque, but they're not F-18s. They're close enough that any aviation enthusiast would recognize them right away. But I think for proprietary reasons, the characters had to be somewhat different. CNN: Do any of the movie characters in \"Planes\" remind you of yourself? Bautista: There are a few characters who have some of my call signs from the military days. Sparky and Dusty are some of my old fighter pilot call signs. But I kind of relate to all the characters. I really like Skipper because he's an old warrior -- an old fighter plane guy from World War ll. He carries a lot in the soul of his character and in his voice. I can relate to that because of some of the unseen, unknown events in his life in the past that affect who he is. Why is he quiet? Why is he kind of a shut-in? I can relate to Dusty and his energy and wanting to go beyond his limitations. I love the fighter characters Bravo and Echo that intercept Dusty. The military sequence was the most fun to work on. CNN: Tell us about your aviation background. Apparently, the filmmakers found someone who knows how to fly a lot of different kinds of aircraft. Bautista: I'm 55. My dad flew bombers in England and France during World War II and finished his career in Strategic Air Command. My brothers and I were all fascinated by airplanes; we grew up near a military base. My younger brother and I both had our pilot's licenses by the time we turned 17, which was the youngest age to get your pilot's license. I flew anything I could get my hands on. In college, I started flying commercially, hauling boxes for FedEx back when nobody knew who they were. I flew old radial engines, twin-engine aircraft called Beech 18 taildraggers. I ended up flying every single-engine Cessna, Piper and Beechcraft built and most of the light twins that they built, like the Cessna 310, 320, 340, 414, Beechcraft Barons, Piper Navajos. Then I wanted to know if I had what it took to be a fighter pilot. I was fortunate enough to get Air Force pilot training through the Air National Guard. I flew F-4 Phantoms and F-16s before retiring as a major. Then I chased another dream: to fly airliners. I ended up flying 737s, 727s, DC-10s and 747s for United. So I have a background in general aviation and then military fighters for 15 years and then commercial for the past 27 years. My son just got picked by the Air National Guard to fly F-15s, so the aviation legacy is continuing into the third generation.",

The stomach-busting meal is the brainchild of Jean-Philippe Grandin, manager of Doddy's Cafe in Boulogne-Billancourt, Paris and an ardent PSG fan. \"We have a lot of homemade burgers on the menu, but I wanted to invent an extraordinary burger,\" Grandin told CNN. \"I am a supporter of Paris Saint-Germain and at the restaurant we show all of the PSG matches.\" Coming inside a chunky custom-made bun, \"Le Zlatan\" stands head and shoulders above the regular burgers on the menu, weighing in at over one kilogram, including 250 grams of bread and 300 grams of cheese. Grandin says this reflects the supremacy of Sweden international Ibrahimovic, who has also played for Ajax, Inter Milan and Barcelona during a glittering career, over every player in Ligue 1. \"In our league we have an extraordinary player, Zlatan Ibrahimovic,\" added Grandin. \"Zlatan is an amazing player, he is the biggest player in the French league.\" And an extraordinary player deserves an extraordinary burger, which is pitched as a meal for two diners or a culinary Everest for one hardy, and hungry, soul. With Ibrahimovic -- who scored 30 league goals during his first season with PSG -- extending his contract at the Parc des Princes until 2016, Grandin has no intention of immortalizing any other footballers in meat anytime soon. \"For the moment nobody can match him,\" he concluded. \"There is just one extraordinary player, so I cannot make another extraordinary burger.\"",

      "article": "(Financial Times) -- BT has achieved its biggest sporting coup yet over Sky, winning the rights to show Champions League football matches in a £900 million ($1,442 million) deal. The deal, announced on Saturday, strikes at the heart of two decades of football broadcasting dominance by Sky. However, it is likely to raise questions about whether BT is paying too much for sports rights, to which it has now committed nearly £2 billion ($3.2 billion). The Champions League is Europe's football premier club competition, and BT, Sky and ITV had all hoped to secure some coverage in this week's tender. Under a three-year agreement starting in 2015, BT will be the only broadcaster to show live Champions League and Europa League games in the UK, paying £299 million ($479 million) per season. That is more than double what Sky and ITV currently pay for the same rights, suggesting that BT bid aggressively under its new chief executive Gavin Patterson. In the tender, ITV is thought to have bid about £63 million ($101 million) per season to show one live game per round, representing an increase of less than one-fifth on its current deal. Sky was prepared to increase its payments by a greater proportion, but could not match BT. \"It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation,\" a Sky spokesperson said in a statement. \"If we thought it was worth more, we'd have paid more.\" TV is part of BT's broader strategy to win customers to its premium fibre broadband packages, which include the sports channels for free at present. The Champions League deal will significantly bolster its channels as serious rivals to Sky in the eyes of viewers and advertisers. BT's shareholders will be keen to see clear returns from such significant investments from a group that has previously focused on cutting costs and streamlining its operations. The group last week revealed a good start in customer numbers, with about 2m people so far having signed up to its channels although the majority would have been existing BT customers. However, the sports rights acquisitions weighed on earnings, and analysts say it is still too early to judge the new sports TV strategy a success.

      "article": "(CNN) -- Tennis bosses have told the sport's stars that a boycott of the 2013 Australian Open over prize money would not be backed. Players have voiced concerns over the disparity between the money earned by stars who reach the latter stages of grand slams and those who exit in the early rounds. British newspaper the Sunday Times reported that they were planning to start a rebel event, possibly in Dubai, if pay is not increased for the Melbourne tournament in January. But the ATP, which represents the interests of male players, has denied it would help players in organize any such action. \"The ATP has been clear and repetitive in telling players that it will not organize a boycott,\" it said in a statement. \"Instead, ATP Management and players have taken a diplomatic approach this year with the grand slams to address player compensation issues. \"The grand slams are important events that generate significant revenues, and the players who perform there should share in an acceptable percentage of those revenues like they do on the ATP World Tour.\" How 'Big Four' earned a pay rise for tennis colleagues . The Australian Open, held in Melbourne every January, is one of four grand slams in tennis -- along with the French and U.S. Opens and Wimbledon. In 2012, first-round losers at the year's first major tournament were given $21,600, compared to $22,500 in France and $23,000 in the U.S. and Britain -- the latter three having increased by 20%. The biggest disparity is in Australia, which has the highest prize purse and biggest winner's check of almost $2.4 million. \"We are pleased that the discussions initiated by the ATP with each of the grand slams this year have resulted in certain prize money increases for players in 2012,\" the men's ruling body said. \"We remain focused on our active dialogue with these events about player compensation for 2013 and beyond. The players remain unified and passionate about this issue.\" Australian Open boss Craig Tiley, in New York for the U.S. Open which began on Monday, attempted to quell boycott fears. \"We are the first to say that for tennis to be a viable career, the top 250 players need to make a good living,\" he told Australian news agency AAP. \"The top 250 players in tennis make about a quarter of the amount of money in tennis as they do in golf. So that could be a good benchmark for us. And the PGA Tour's prize money has increased more than the ATP Tour's has, so we have to address that too. \"Our relationship with the playing group is very, very strong. It's in everyone's interests (not to strike). We're very confident that whatever needs to be resolved will be.\"",

      "summary1": "Tennis players have been threatening to boycott the Australian Open because it pays less than the other major tournaments. While this year's champion will receive nearly $2.4 million, the lower ranked players earn significantly less. The prize money for players in other tournaments has increased in recent years, so there is hope that this issue will be resolved through dialogue among players and tennis bosses.",

Players have voiced concerns over the disparity between the money earned by stars who reach the latter stages of grand slams and those who exit in the early rounds. British newspaper the Sunday Times reported that they were planning to start a rebel event, possibly in Dubai, if pay is not increased for the Melbourne tournament in January. But the ATP, which represents the interests of male players, has denied it would help players in organize any such action. \"The ATP has been clear and repetitive in telling players that it will not organize a boycott,\" it said in a statement. \"Instead, ATP Management and players have taken a diplomatic approach this year with the grand slams to address player compensation issues. \"The grand slams are important events that generate significant revenues, and the players who perform there should share in an acceptable percentage of those revenues like they do on the ATP World Tour.\" How 'Big Four' earned a pay rise for tennis colleagues . The Australian Open, held in Melbourne every January, is one of four grand slams in tennis -- along with the French and U.S. Opens and Wimbledon. In 2012, first-round losers at the year's first major tournament were given $21,600, compared to $22,500 in France and $23,000 in the U.S. and Britain -- the latter three having increased by 20%. The biggest disparity is in Australia, which has the highest prize purse and biggest winner's check of almost $2.4 million. \"We are pleased that the discussions initiated by the ATP with each of the grand slams this year have resulted in certain prize money increases for players in 2012,\" the men's ruling body said. \"We remain focused on our active dialogue with these events about player compensation for 2013 and beyond. The players remain unified and passionate about this issue.\" Australian Open boss Craig Tiley, in New York for the U.S. Open which began on Monday, attempted to quell boycott fears. \"We are the first to say that for tennis to be a viable career, the top 250 players need to make a good living,\" he told Australian news agency AAP. \"The top 250 players in tennis make about a quarter of the amount of money in tennis as they do in golf. So that could be a good benchmark for us. And the PGA Tour's prize money has increased more than the ATP Tour's has, so we have to address that too. \"Our relationship with the playing group is very, very strong. It's in everyone's interests (not to strike). We're very confident that whatever needs to be resolved will be.\"\nSummary:\n",

Australian kids are consuming more than two serves of fatty food and at least one sugary drink each day, which is directly having an impact on their weight gain. A long-term Deakin University study also found for each unhealthy item consumed by children, their BMI score increased. The new study looked at 4,164 children from ages four to 10, with data collected over four time periods every two years. It classed fatty foods as hamburgers, hot chips, potato chips, doughnuts, cake or chocolate. Sugary drinks included cordial, soft drinks and fruit juice. A Victorian university study has found children are eating more than two serves of fatty foods and consuming at least one sugary drink a day . It found six-years-olds consumed 1.4 serves of sugary drinks a day and 1.9 serves of fatty foods. At 10 years, this increased to 1.5 serves per day for sugary drinks. Deakin University WHO Collaborating Centre for Obesity Prevention's Dr Lynne Millar said many would say 'yes we already know this', but studies to date had been inconclusive. 'Some [found] a connection between sugary drinks and fatty foods and children's weight and others not,' she said.

And April's numbers from the Labor Department didn't provide President Obama a lot to brag about. \"After the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, our businesses have now created more than 4.2 million new jobs over the last 26 months, more than 1 million jobs in the six months alone. So that's the good news,\" Obama said Friday at an event in northern Virginia. But the president went on to say, \"There are still a lot of folks out of work, which means we gotta do more. If we're going to recover all the jobs lost during the recession, and if we're going to build a secure economy that strengthens the middle class, then we're going to have to do more.\" Consider this: No sitting president facing an unemployment rate more than 8% has won another term since Franklin D. Roosevelt. So the headline from the Labor Department report Friday morning that the nation's unemployment level edged down from 8.2% in March to 8.1% in April sure seemed like good news for an incumbent president fighting for re-election. Especially since just about every poll indicates that the economy remains the top issue on the minds of Americans and that jobs remain the top economic concern. CNNMoney.com: Why Obama can't match the Reagan recovery . But the Labor Department also reported that the number of jobs rose last month by 115,000, much lower than many economists had predicted. According to the report, 342,000 workers dropped out of the labor force, with the labor force participation rate, now at 63.6%, at its lowest level since 1981. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee was quick to react to the jobs numbers. \"It's a terrible and very disappointing report this morning. Clearly the American people are wondering why this recovery isn't happening faster, what's taking years and years for the recovery to occur. And we seem to be slowing down, not speeding up. This is not progress,\" Mitt Romney said Friday in an interview on Fox News just minutes after the 8:30 a.m. ET release of the Labor Department report. Romney says no celebration until 4% unemployment rate . \"A lot of American people are having difficult times, and this is not good news this morning,\" added the former Massachusetts governor, who argued the reason the rate dropped was because more people are leaving the workforce. Republicans quick to react to jobs report . Romney's strategy is simple: Make the election a referendum on the president's record on the economy and jobs, and argue that Obama isn't doing a good job on creating jobs. With six months to go until Election Day, a top Republican strategist says the jobs report spells trouble for the president. \"A disappointing jobs report means two things: One, President Obama is more likely to lose his job. Now, this election will increasingly become a referendum on Obama's performance. Voters may or may not believe Mitt Romney can turn things around, but it is becoming clearer that Obama's plan isn't going to cut it,\" says GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. \"Two, to win, President Obama has to run the most brutal, negative, polarizing campaign in history -- on every subject but the economy. He has to pit young against old, rich against poor, women against men, and try to divide the country on other issues. I don't think that's the kind of country we want to be,\" said Castellanos, who was a top media adviser for Romney's 2008 nomination bid. \"Anytime you have to explain bad news, you've already lost. The Obama campaign has done the best they can with stubbornly high unemployment, talking about the number of jobs created and not the number of people who don't have jobs. But this doesn't help the general sense of unease about the economy among middle class Americans,\" says Rich Galen, who ran Newt Gingrich's press operation when he was speaker of the House and advised Fred Thompson's 2008 Republican presidential bid. But be careful what you wish for, says Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala. \"Every time there's bad economic news for the middle class, the Champagne corks pop at one of Mitt Romney's many mansions.

A CNN/ORC International poll conducted last month indicated that Americans were split on which candidate could best jumpstart the economy, with 44% saying Obama would be more likely to get the economy moving and 42% saying that Romney would do a better job to stimulate the economy.

      "article": "In the midst of the recent uprising of Islamic militants in Iraq - and the thousands of Iraqis they've slaughtered as they try to take over the violence-plagued country - former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney-Perry, a one-time assistant secretary of state, are speaking out about the series of 'wrong' decisions the Obama administration has made that made the uprising possible. Last week, a group of Islamic extremists began an insurgency throughout Iraq and have taken over several cities - including Fallujah, Tikrit, Mosul and Tel Afar - on their way to Baghdad. After saying he wouldn't send U.S. troops to the region, Obama sent 250 soldiers to guard the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Harsh: Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz - a former deputy assistant secretary of state - have harsh words for Obama's handling of the insurgency in Iraq . Jihad: Earlier this month, a jihadi group of Islamic militants called the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria began taking over cities in Iraq . The Cheneys oppose the president's plan for the uprising so far, and are critical of his actions before the uprisings that allowed the jihadi group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to grow. 'Rarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much at the expense . of so many,' the Cheneys wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. 'Too many times to count, Mr. Obama has told us he is . \"ending\" the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan‚öÑÆas though wishing made it so. His rhetoric has now come crashing into reality. Watching the black-clad . ISIS jihadists take territory once secured by American blood is final . proof, if any were needed, that America's enemies are not \"decimated.\" They are emboldened and on the march.' The Cheneys contend that the uprising in Iraq is not just a threat to Iraqis, but to Americans, as well, as the country could become a safe-haven for al Qaeda and other terrorist groups that could carry out 9/11-style attacks on the U.S. and its allies. Fore! The Cheneys say that while the situation in Iraq escalates, Obama is playing golf and talking about climate change . The Cheneys mention trips they've been on to the Middle East, where government officials are confused as to what Obama has been doing in the region following the wars in Irag and Afghanistan, and say that the president is abandoning the few friends the U.S. has in the Arab world. 'In one Arab capital, a senior official pulled out a map of Syria and . Iraq,' the Cheneys write. 'Drawing an arc with his finger from Raqqa province in northern . Syria to Anbar province in western Iraq, he said, \"They will control . this territory. Al Qaeda is building safe havens and training camps . here. Don't the Americans care?\" 'Our president doesn't seem to. Iraq is at risk of falling to a radical . Islamic terror group and Mr. Obama is talking climate change. Terrorists . take control of more territory and resources than ever before in . history, and he goes golfing. He seems blithely unaware, or indifferent . to the fact, that a resurgent al Qaeda presents a clear and present . danger to the United States of America.' Brutal: ISIS crucified this man and left a note on his body saying 'Cleanliness is a civilized matter that shows ur ethics and love for country . Murderers: ISIS has reportedly driven through Iraqi cities and indiscriminately shot at random citizens . After the Iraq War, the Cheneys say al Qaeda was nearly defeated in the country thanks primarily to military efforts by the U.S. and its allies. Rather than stay in the country and make sure the peace was preserved, Obama pulled the U.S. out of the unfinished conflict, according to the Cheneys. Mr. Obama had only to negotiate an agreement to leave behind some . residual American forces, training and intelligence capabilities to help . secure the peace. Instead, he abandoned Iraq and we are watching . American defeat snatched from the jaws of victory. The Cheneys cite a Rand study that shows a 58 percent increase in the number of Salafi-jihadists between 2010 and 2013. They say that 'in the face of this threat, Mr. Obama is busy ushering America's adversaries into positions of power in the Middle East.' 'First it was the Russians in Syria. Now, in a move that defies . credulity, he toys with the idea of ushering Iran into Iraq,' they write. 'Only a fool . would believe American policy in Iraq should be ceded to Iran, the . world's largest state sponsor of terror.' Violence: The number of Iraqis executed by ISIS since the uprising began is in the thousands . They write that there is 'a dire need for American leadership around the world' and that the president has failed our allies by abandoning conflicts before they are actually over. 'It is time the president and his allies faced some hard truths: America . remains at war, and withdrawing troops from the field of battle while . our enemies stay in the fight does not \"end\" wars.

      "prompt": "Write a three sentence summary of the article.\nArticle:\nIn the midst of the recent uprising of Islamic militants in Iraq - and the thousands of Iraqis they've slaughtered as they try to take over the violence-plagued country - former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney-Perry, a one-time assistant secretary of state, are speaking out about the series of 'wrong' decisions the Obama administration has made that made the uprising possible. Last week, a group of Islamic extremists began an insurgency throughout Iraq and have taken over several cities - including Fallujah, Tikrit, Mosul and Tel Afar - on their way to Baghdad. After saying he wouldn't send U.S. troops to the region, Obama sent 250 soldiers to guard the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Harsh: Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz - a former deputy assistant secretary of state - have harsh words for Obama's handling of the insurgency in Iraq . Jihad: Earlier this month, a jihadi group of Islamic militants called the Islamic States of Iraq and Syria began taking over cities in Iraq . The Cheneys oppose the president's plan for the uprising so far, and are critical of his actions before the uprisings that allowed the jihadi group Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to grow. 'Rarely has a U.S. president been so wrong about so much at the expense . of so many,' the Cheneys wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. 'Too many times to count, Mr. Obama has told us he is . \"ending\" the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan‚öÑÆas though wishing made it so. His rhetoric has now come crashing into reality. Watching the black-clad . ISIS jihadists take territory once secured by American blood is final . proof, if any were needed, that America's enemies are not \"decimated.\" They are emboldened and on the march.' The Cheneys contend that the uprising in Iraq is not just a threat to Iraqis, but to Americans, as well, as the country could become a safe-haven for al Qaeda and other terrorist groups that could carry out 9/11-style attacks on the U.S. and its allies. Fore! The Cheneys say that while the situation in Iraq escalates, Obama is playing golf and talking about climate change . The Cheneys mention trips they've been on to the Middle East, where government officials are confused as to what Obama has been doing in the region following the wars in Irag and Afghanistan, and say that the president is abandoning the few friends the U.S. has in the Arab world. 'In one Arab capital, a senior official pulled out a map of Syria and . Iraq,' the Cheneys write. 'Drawing an arc with his finger from Raqqa province in northern . Syria to Anbar province in western Iraq, he said, \"They will control . this territory. Al Qaeda is building safe havens and training camps . here. Don't the Americans care?\" 'Our president doesn't seem to. Iraq is at risk of falling to a radical . Islamic terror group and Mr. Obama is talking climate change. Terrorists . take control of more territory and resources than ever before in . history, and he goes golfing. He seems blithely unaware, or indifferent . to the fact, that a resurgent al Qaeda presents a clear and present . danger to the United States of America.' Brutal: ISIS crucified this man and left a note on his body saying 'Cleanliness is a civilized matter that shows ur ethics and love for country . Murderers: ISIS has reportedly driven through Iraqi cities and indiscriminately shot at random citizens . After the Iraq War, the Cheneys say al Qaeda was nearly defeated in the country thanks primarily to military efforts by the U.S. and its allies. Rather than stay in the country and make sure the peace was preserved, Obama pulled the U.S. out of the unfinished conflict, according to the Cheneys. Mr. Obama had only to negotiate an agreement to leave behind some . residual American forces, training and intelligence capabilities to help . secure the peace. Instead, he abandoned Iraq and we are watching . American defeat snatched from the jaws of victory. The Cheneys cite a Rand study that shows a 58 percent increase in the number of Salafi-jihadists between 2010 and 2013. They say that 'in the face of this threat, Mr. Obama is busy ushering America's adversaries into positions of power in the Middle East.' 'First it was the Russians in Syria. Now, in a move that defies . credulity, he toys with the idea of ushering Iran into Iraq,' they write. 'Only a fool . would believe American policy in Iraq should be ceded to Iran, the . world's largest state sponsor of terror.' Violence: The number of Iraqis executed by ISIS since the uprising began is in the thousands . They write that there is 'a dire need for American leadership around the world' and that the president has failed our allies by abandoning conflicts before they are actually over. 'It is time the president and his allies faced some hard truths: America . remains at war, and withdrawing troops from the field of battle while . our enemies stay in the fight does not \"end\" wars. Weakness and retreat . are provocative. U.S. withdrawal from the world is disastrous and puts . our own security at risk,' the Cheneys write. They went on to quote former President - and conservative hero - Ronald Reagan. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan said, \"If history teaches anything, it . teaches that simple-minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our . adversaries is folly.

NICE says parents in ‚öÑ≤denial' about their children being obese should also be identified to prevent them becoming a barrier to weight loss. The watchdog claims parents may undermine efforts to get fat children and teenagers to face up to the problem. ‚öÑ≤Efforts to manage a child or young person's weight are not always supported, and are sometimes undermined, by members of the wider family,' it said.' The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has released new guidelines for health workers which say parents should be encouraged to find ways to make their children less sedentary in their daily life . ‚öÑ≤This is possibly because of a lack of . understanding of the aims of lifestyle weight management programmes and . the importance of managing the weight of obese or overweight children . and young people. It added that a ‚öÑ≤lack of recognition, or denial' can prevent them from joining, and adhering to, a weight management course. These programmes can include Weight Watchers, which Nice has already approved as a way for GPs to assist patients in losing weight. In 2011 in England, around 30 per cent of boys and girls aged two to 15 were either overweight or obese. In the 2011/2012 school year, around 23 per cent of children in reception, and 34 per cent in year six, were either overweight or obese.\nSummary:\n",

      "article": "A Twitter-user signposted cyber-attacks which crippled the Home Office website by flooding it with huge amounts of internet traffic, a jury has heard. Mark Johnson, 44, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, is accused of encouraging the attack by the international hacking group Anonymous, which sent the Government sites into meltdown. The prosecution say Johnson encouraged a cyber-attack on websites run by the Home Office and Home Secretary Theresa May by posting links on his Twitter page. Mark Johnson (pictured) is accused of encouraging the attack by the international hacking group Anonymous . Johnson is alleged to have posted a link on his social media account which meant other web users could join in with the hacking attack launched by the cyber activist group Anonymous in 2012. A court heard the Distributed Denial Of Service (DDOS) attack - where a website is flooded with traffic to make it crash - took place between June 15 and June 18, 2012. It began when hackers Anonymous posted a video on YouTube on June 12 which announced 'Operation Theresa May' - a two-day online assault on the Home Secretary. Home secretary Theresa May was targeted as part of a two-day online assault by hacking group Anonymous . Johnson is accused of posting a link to the code for the attack on the Home Office on his Twitter page @mlyjohn on June 15, 2012. The court heard his tweet has since been deleted and he told police somebody must have hacked into his account to post the link. But the jury of 10 women and two men were told computer experts had analysed his computer and found there was no evidence of anyone accessing his device. Johnson denies one charge of encouraging or assisting an offence under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act 1990. Timothy Devlin, opening the prosecution case on the first day of his trial at Birmingham Crown Court, said: 'What this really is a case about is computer hacking. 'The offence was what is called a Distributed Denial Of Service. What we accuse Mr Johnson of doing is helping others to crash the Home Office computers. 'DDOS is a situation where a large number of people simultaneously make requests of a website. The Crown alleges Johnson, of Josiah Wedgwood Street, assisted in the web attacks on both the Home Office website and the home secretary's constituency website by posting a 'malicious' weblink through his Twitter account which, when clicked, allowed a web-user to add their connection to the cyber assault. 'We say Mark Johnson published that link in his Twitter account,' said Mr Devlin. 'He was saying 'if you want to help close down the Home Office and Theresa May's website, here's the link'.' He added: 'We say Mark Johnson published links on Twitter for people to get involved in these joint attacks.' Mr Devlin told the court the DDOS attack used a malicious webpage which opened connections to the Home Office page in large numbers. He said the Government website received a message saying 'we are legion' - which is a phrase from the Bible used by Anonymous - every time someone clicked on the link for the attack. The court heard in just under 30 minutes from 9.34pm on June 17, 2012, 8,347 connections were made to the Government site - rendering it unresponsive to users and causing it to be taken down. The sheer weight of connections meant that an alternative 'disaster recovery' version of the site had to be put online in place of the main site, Mr Devlin told the court. Mr Devlin added: 'It (the Home Office page) was being bombarded so quickly they had to take it down and a substitute was put on the internet with reduced functionality. 'It was there to replace the real website, normal service was resumed the following day (June 18, 2012). Johnson denies one charge of encouraging or assisting an offence under Section 3(1) of the Computer Misuse Act 1990 . 'These connections, the 8,347, were made by a variety of originators of the same DDOS message being circulated. 'That means a large number of people were able to click on a connection which then sent a message to the Home Office website and that helped close it down. 'During the attack on the Home Office website, Theresa May's constituency website was also attack from links posted on Twitter. The website ceased to function. 'And what we are saying is that Mark Johnson published that link in his Twitter account. 'So what he was doing was saying if you want to help close down the Home Office and Theresa May websites then here is the link and other people look at that and click that link. 'Mr Johnson says no I didn't, it must have been somebody else using my Twitter account. 'If Mr Johnson is saying this wasn't me that posted this on my Twitter account then it must have been someone else and how did they do it because they don't have his password. 'You're going to hear evidence that on the day he was arrested all his computers were taken and they've all been examined by an expert and no malware, no Trojans or no other performance email has gone in to that account which has enabled another person to steal his password. 'So the only person who had that password was Mark Johnson.' The court heard after police traced Mr Johnson to his home he deleted his tweet from June15 and changed his Twitter account from an open setting to a private one. His @mlyjohn account, has a header picture showing numerous images of the infamous Guy Fawkes white mask motif used by Anonymous. Mr Devlin explained to the trial jury at Birmingham Crown Court that Johnson does not deny supporting some of global hacking group Anonymous' campaigns. Johnson, who wore a white shirt with a dark suit jacket, sat in the dock listening intently to proceedings. Jurors also heard in August 2012, two months after the Home Office attack, Johnson posted a link to an Anonymous group YouTube video regarding another cyber attack, which this time targeted the San Francisco public transport system in the United States.

      "article": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Creating and saving jobs while boosting investment in the future are among the top goals of the Obama administration's $787 billion economic stimulus plan. President Obama chats with students at a Silver Spring, Maryland, elementary school this week. And according to a preliminary report on stimulus funding for schools by the Department of Education and the Domestic Policy Council, the stimulus plan has created jobs. State governments have created and saved at least 250,000 education jobs -- and restored nearly all their projected education budget shortfalls for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 -- according to preliminary findings released Monday by the White House. But some states that used the funds to fill existing budget gaps could face a crisis when the money runs out after 2010. And the Department of Education has chastised certain states for their stimulus funding programs and warned them that they risk their chances at getting other DOE grants down the road. The stimulus funds appropriated $48.6 billion for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund to help keep and create jobs and advance education reforms over a period of two years, the report said. The program dedicates $39.8 billion for public elementary, secondary and higher education and other services. Another $8.8 billion will go for other activities such as public safety or government services. \"To date, $35.5 billion of the SFSF allotment has been obligated and $13.2 [billion] is forthcoming,\" the report added. In a recent memo, the Department of Education's inspector general's office warned Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania about not following the rules. At issue is the government's \"maintenance of effort\" provision, which makes states receiving stimulus funds promise to maintain funding at fiscal year 2006 levels. The provision also requires states to pledge to use these funds to advance certain education reforms: increasing teacher effectiveness, implementing statewide data systems, and providing support for struggling schools. The September 30 memo pointed out states are using K-12 stimulus funds to fill gaps in their education budgets due to decreasing revenues and resources. Pennsylvania's actions led to a terse letter on June 18 from Education Secretary Arne Duncan to Gov. Ed Rendell. The letter said: \"If a State has disproportionately reduced its education budget and/or if a State has done nothing more than backfill budget holes with these dollars when the State had other resources available to it, such as a rainy-day fund, the State's competitive position to receive ... competitive grants may be negatively impacted.\" Those states employing the practice, some argue, will face dire straits in fiscal year 2011 when the stimulus funding runs out. \"States and districts were repeatedly warned about funding [problems],\" said Chad Aldeman, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan think tank Education Sector. But Aldeman notes that there may have been a lack of communication between states and the federal government over how to spend the money. \"They [states] were told to focus on one-time investments as much as possible,\" he said. \"At the same time, the Department of Education sold this as a job and reform package. ... They say on one hand, preserve and create jobs.

      "prompt": "Write a three sentence summary of the article.\nArticle:\nWASHINGTON (CNN) -- Creating and saving jobs while boosting investment in the future are among the top goals of the Obama administration's $787 billion economic stimulus plan. President Obama chats with students at a Silver Spring, Maryland, elementary school this week. And according to a preliminary report on stimulus funding for schools by the Department of Education and the Domestic Policy Council, the stimulus plan has created jobs. State governments have created and saved at least 250,000 education jobs -- and restored nearly all their projected education budget shortfalls for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 -- according to preliminary findings released Monday by the White House. But some states that used the funds to fill existing budget gaps could face a crisis when the money runs out after 2010. And the Department of Education has chastised certain states for their stimulus funding programs and warned them that they risk their chances at getting other DOE grants down the road. The stimulus funds appropriated $48.6 billion for the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund to help keep and create jobs and advance education reforms over a period of two years, the report said. The program dedicates $39.8 billion for public elementary, secondary and higher education and other services. Another $8.8 billion will go for other activities such as public safety or government services. \"To date, $35.5 billion of the SFSF allotment has been obligated and $13.2 [billion] is forthcoming,\" the report added. In a recent memo, the Department of Education's inspector general's office warned Connecticut, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania about not following the rules. At issue is the government's \"maintenance of effort\" provision, which makes states receiving stimulus funds promise to maintain funding at fiscal year 2006 levels. The provision also requires states to pledge to use these funds to advance certain education reforms: increasing teacher effectiveness, implementing statewide data systems, and providing support for struggling schools. The September 30 memo pointed out states are using K-12 stimulus funds to fill gaps in their education budgets due to decreasing revenues and resources. Pennsylvania's actions led to a terse letter on June 18 from Education Secretary Arne Duncan to Gov. Ed Rendell. The letter said: \"If a State has disproportionately reduced its education budget and/or if a State has done nothing more than backfill budget holes with these dollars when the State had other resources available to it, such as a rainy-day fund, the State's competitive position to receive ... competitive grants may be negatively impacted.\" Those states employing the practice, some argue, will face dire straits in fiscal year 2011 when the stimulus funding runs out. \"States and districts were repeatedly warned about funding [problems],\" said Chad Aldeman, a policy analyst with the nonpartisan think tank Education Sector. But Aldeman notes that there may have been a lack of communication between states and the federal government over how to spend the money. \"They [states] were told to focus on one-time investments as much as possible,\" he said. \"At the same time, the Department of Education sold this as a job and reform package. ... They say on one hand, preserve and create jobs. On the other hand, they talk about education reform.\" The Obama administration argues the early results from Monday's report show the money already is having an effect. \"This is one more indication of how the Recovery Act is helping soften the blow of tough times, by keeping educators on the job and teachers in the classroom,\" Vice President Joe Biden said in a statement.

The 29-year-old overall World Cup champion recorded an unprecedented 24th podium finish of the season by claiming victory in the giant slalom at Lenzerheide, Switerland. Any disappointment at missing out on the downhill title to Lindsey Vonn was well and truly vanquished as Maze stormed to yet more success. The Slovenia star, who has already won the super-G and slalom crystal globes, is only the second skier ever to break the 2000 points barrier in the season. Her total of 2,414 points, a record, came after she clocked a time of two minutes 16.67 seconds over the two legs to finish ahead of France's Tessa Worley and home favorite Lara Gut. \"I have even impressed myself. It has been an incredible season, \"Maze told reporters. \"If someone had said to me before the start of the season I would achieve all this, I would have said they were mad,\" said Maze. \"I don't think that this is the fruit of just one year of hard work. \"One obviously requires talent and the need to work hard, but also to have a good team round oneself. Skiing is an individual sport, but there is a team around you to help you.\" From the 900 points on offer for the Giant Slalom title, Maze collected 800 of them, winning on five occasions as well as finishing second three times and third once. She told the competition's official website: \"It's an incredible record, but I could have scored more points if the last Super G and Downhill weren't canceled. \"I'm impressed by all these achievements. It's been an amazing season for me. My skiing has been so good. I started with a win and finished with another one. \"That's the way to go when you're so strong. I'm so proud of me and my team.

Chancellor George Osborne's plans to claw back child benefit from better-off families have been criticised for being too complicated . Thousands of people earning more than £50,000 will lose some of their pay if they move in with a new partner who has children, accountants have warned. Tax experts at Deloitte said the ‚öÑ≤bizarre' anomaly was the result of government plans to claw back child benefit from homes where at least one resident is a higher earner. The changes are due to come into force in just 10 weeks, and the Treasury has been forced to insist they remain on track despite hundreds of thousands of families affected being in the dark that they will lose money from January 1. Letters are due to be sent to all those paid under PAYE and earning more than £50,000 by HM Revenue and Customs next week. Yesterday MailOnline revealed child benefit is being paid to 40,000 children living outside the UK, despite plans to cut the money for families in the UK. Under the changes, if one person in the home earns £50,000 or more, the entitlement to child benefit will be gradually cut. If anyone earns more than £60,000, they will lose child benefit all together. But instead of reducing the amount of child benefit paid out, the money is to be clawed back in additional tax imposed on the higher earner, regardless of whether they are the person who receives child benefit or even a parent. It means 500,000 people will have to fill out self-assessment tax forms for the first time. Patricia Mock, a tax director in Deloitte's private client services division, said: ‚öÑ≤If you have a standard family with 2.4 children and two married parents all living together then the system is reasonably straightforward. ‚öÑ≤But it can get really bizarre. Take that straightforward family. If the parents get divorced and the children live with the mother who has a new partner, and that partner is the higher earner, then he gets [to pay] the clawback even though they are not his children,' she told the Daily Telegraph. Ms Mock added: ‚öÑ≤Some scenarios look overcomplicated, but in today's complex family arrangements, they may well happen.' If an estranged father is claiming child benefit for children who live with their mother and this father has a new partner – who happens to earn more than him – then this partner may be liable to pay the money back if they earn over the threshold. A spokesman for HMRC insisted the process of explaining the changes was on course, but admitted new partners could be liable for the charge following a divorce. He added: ‚öÑ≤Letters explaining the new child benefit rules are ready to be sent and will be issued in batches from next week, on schedule and according to plan. 'There are no delays, and plenty of time for those affected to consider their options and make an informed choice in time for the 7 January rule change. ‚öÑ≤We will also launch a section on our website designed specifically to help taxpayers with the new arrangements.'",

      "article": "(CNN) -- He won the World Cup with Italy in 2006 -- now Gennaro Gattuso is being investigated on match fixing charges. The 35-year-old was an integral part of Marcelo Lippi's squad, playing all 180 minutes of the final against France, which Italy eventually won on penalties. But on Tuesday he was named in a statement on the official website of the Italian Football Federation that provided an update into an ongoing match fixing investigation by prosecutors in Cremona. It said that four men had been arrested over matches that were allegedly fixed in Italy's top tier three seasons ago. Gattuso, as well as another former AC Milan star, Cristian Brocchi, who also played for Inter and Lazio, were not detained but had their homes raided as part of the probe which is focused on games in the 2010-11 season. The combative midfielder spent 13 years at Milan, winning two European Champions League titles, two Serie A crowns and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2007. He was also part of the victorious Italy squad that won the 2006 World Cup in Germany, defeating France on penalties in the final. Gattuso turned to management after his playing career ended, taking charge at Swiss club Sion before he was relieved of his duties. His next appointment saw him take the reins at Palermo prior to the start of the current league season in Italy but he was sacked after winning just two games and replaced by Giuseppe Iachini. These allegations are the latest in a long line of stories that have plagued Italian football over recent years as prosecutors continue their probe into illegal betting and match fixing. Juventus manager Antonio Conte was handed with a 10-month suspension, later reduced to four, for failing to report match fixing while in charge of Siena, who then played in the Italian second tier. Former Lazio and Italy striker Giuseppe Signori was banned for five years while Stefano Mauri, and ex-Atalanta captain Cristiano Doni have also served suspensions.

The 35-year-old was an integral part of Marcelo Lippi's squad, playing all 180 minutes of the final against France, which Italy eventually won on penalties. But on Tuesday he was named in a statement on the official website of the Italian Football Federation that provided an update into an ongoing match fixing investigation by prosecutors in Cremona. It said that four men had been arrested over matches that were allegedly fixed in Italy's top tier three seasons ago. Gattuso, as well as another former AC Milan star, Cristian Brocchi, who also played for Inter and Lazio, were not detained but had their homes raided as part of the probe which is focused on games in the 2010-11 season. The combative midfielder spent 13 years at Milan, winning two European Champions League titles, two Serie A crowns and the FIFA Club World Cup in 2007. He was also part of the victorious Italy squad that won the 2006 World Cup in Germany, defeating France on penalties in the final. Gattuso turned to management after his playing career ended, taking charge at Swiss club Sion before he was relieved of his duties. His next appointment saw him take the reins at Palermo prior to the start of the current league season in Italy but he was sacked after winning just two games and replaced by Giuseppe Iachini. These allegations are the latest in a long line of stories that have plagued Italian football over recent years as prosecutors continue their probe into illegal betting and match fixing. Juventus manager Antonio Conte was handed with a 10-month suspension, later reduced to four, for failing to report match fixing while in charge of Siena, who then played in the Italian second tier. Former Lazio and Italy striker Giuseppe Signori was banned for five years while Stefano Mauri, and ex-Atalanta captain Cristiano Doni have also served suspensions.

The service's European Command said this week that 12 A-10 Thunderbolts would be deployed to Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, as part of Operation Atlantic Resolve, which was formed after Russia's intervention in Ukraine over the past year. \"The Air Force is increasing rotational presence in Europe to reassure our allies and partner nations that our commitment to European security is a priority,\" Lt.

The Air Force said besides operating in Germany, the A-10s will be forward deployed to other partner nations in Eastern Europe. U.S. forces have operated out of bases in Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia and Poland, among others, in the past year. The A-10, also known as the \"Warthog,\" was designed in the 1970s to support ground troops in Europe against the tanks and armored vehicles of the then-Soviet Union. Though the jets can carry a variety of bombs and missiles, they are best known for their nose-mounted, seven-barrel 30 mm Gatling gun that can fire almost 4,000 rounds per minute, enough to quickly blow apart a tank. The planes are also durable, with the pilot protected from ground fire by a wrapping of titanium often called \"the bathtub.\" And they are designed for easy maintenance in battlefield areas, with interchangeable parts for the right and left sides of the aircraft. Those capabilities have been battle-proven in Iraq, Afghanistan and the Balkans. Late last year, A-10s were deployed in support of Operation Inherent Resolve, the U.S. military campaign against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in January that the A-10s had flown 11% of the Air Force's missions against ISIS despite coming into the conflict more than two months after initial U.S. involvement. Despite its current usefulness, the A-10 is on the Defense Department's chopping block, with the Air Force wanting to turn over the jet's ground support mission to its newest fighter, the F-35. Critics of the move say the A-10 can do better than the F-35 because it can get lower and slower, allowing pilots to get real eyes on targets. And they say it is way cheaper than the F-35, with a flight hour for the A-10 costing roughly half of what it costs to operate the F-35, according to numerous reports. The Air Force says it just doesn't have the money to support the A-10, which will be more than 40 years old at its planned retirement in 2019, and its newest, more advanced aircraft. \"It's not about not liking or not wanting the A-10.

      "article": "(CNN) -- As the U.S. continues limited, targeted airstrikes for the third day in Iraq, political divisions around the scope of U.S. involvement are emerging in Washington. Top-ranking Democrats who appeared on political talk shows Sunday advocated for a limited mission and insisted that the Iraqi government must respond to the growing threat of the extreme militant group ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State but formerly was known as the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Republicans, meanwhile, are advocating a far more aggressive stance, insisting that ISIS poses a direct threat to the U.S. They urged President Barack Obama to do more than the limited airstrikes he announced Friday. ISIS, which obtained sustained power in parts of Syria, has expanded its deadly grip on parts of Iraq, especially the Kurdish north, where tens of thousands of Yazidi minorities had been forced into mountains, where they're stranded without food and water. Up to 60 children are among those who have died from the extreme conditions. Thousands of Yazidis rescued, Iraqi Human Rights Ministry spokesman says . Dehydration or massacre: Thousands caught in ISIS chokehold . The militant group executes civilians who don't adhere to its version of Sunni Islam. Its goal is to create an Islamic caliphate, which it claims it has already done, calling the regions they control in Iraq and Syria the Islamic State. Obama announced airstrikes to protect the hundreds of Americans working in the region and said humanitarian assistance to Kurdish minorities would be part of a limited mission that he described as a \"long-term project.\" But in Washington, Republicans harshly criticized the President and his mission, saying it is too little, too late. The U.S. role . \"ISIS continues to make gains everywhere,\" Republican Sen. John McCain said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Obama's approach to protect military and diplomatic personnel in the area, McCain said, is \"narrow\" in scope and \"clearly very, very ineffective, to say the least.\" \"That's not a strategy,\" he said, calling for additional airstrikes in Iraq and Syria to dismantle ISIS and to provide additional military equipment to the Kurds and the Syrian fighters who oppose ISIS. Officials: U.S. airstrikes pound ISIS militants firing at Iraq's Yazidis . That sentiment for an expanded involvement was echoed by Rep. Peter King, R-New York. \"I am saying we should do whatever we have to do,\" the House Homeland Security Committee member said on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" including, \"we take nothing off the table.\" On Sunday, Democrats, however, expressed support for the President's targeted airstrikes and cautioned against any broader involvement. \"Escalating it is not on the cards,\" Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, said on \"Meet the Press.\" \"We cannot send the troops. We must not send the troops.\" But King insisted his support for a broader operation, which includes \"massive aircraft,\" does not involve U.S. combat troops back into the country after nearly a decade of war and three years after the troops left. \"Let's not set up the false argument that there have to be troops on the ground,\" he said. The role of Iraqis . Democrats said Sunday that the U.S. can do little beyond provide humanitarian assistance and protect American personnel. They said it is ultimately up to Iraqis to address the crisis engulfing their country. \"Only Iraq can save Iraq,\" Durbin said. \"If Iraqis come together, al-Maliki put in power someone in power with the Shias and Kurds, perhaps they can do it themselves.\" The U.S. relationship with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has deteriorated. He has been blamed for escalating tensions between religious and ethnic sects within Iraq between the Shia majority, the Sunni minority, the Kurds and smaller groups of minorities, causing the destabilization of the country. The Iraqi Parliament is expected to choose a new prime minister soon, and Democrats say that the new leader should unite the shattered country. Democrats say that political reconciliation in Baghdad would be able to address the crisis, which Sen. Ben Cardin, D- Maryland, called a \"civil war.\" \"The real cause is that the Iraqi government has not performed the way it should to protect the rights of all Iraqis,\" Cardin said on \"Fox news Sunday.\" Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, agreed that the U.S. is not responsible for repairing a country fraught with political divisions. \"This has to be a political strategy that takes place in Baghdad and not in Washington,\" he said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation.\" But King lambasted the Democrats, saying they are providing a limited view of Iraq and the threat of ISIS. He insisted that the problem is much deeper than intra-Iraq turmoil. Threat to the U.S. He called the Democrats' position, which is similar to the one Obama expressed this past week, a \"shameful abdication of American leadership.\" King said ISIS is a threat beyond Iraq and Syria, calling the group more powerful than al Qaeda was on September 11, 2001, when the U.S. was attacked. \"I want to hear what he says when they attack us in the United States,\" King said of ISIS. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, offered a similar, dire sentiment of the threat from the militant group shunned by al Qaeda because of its extreme, violent tactics. \"I think of an American city in flames because of the terrorist ability to operate in Syria and Iraq,\" he said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Whatever you want to call these guys, they are coming here.\" Mideast spiraling in war and terror .

Republicans, meanwhile, are advocating a far more aggressive stance, insisting that ISIS poses a direct threat to the U.S. They urged President Barack Obama to do more than the limited airstrikes he announced Friday. ISIS, which obtained sustained power in parts of Syria, has expanded its deadly grip on parts of Iraq, especially the Kurdish north, where tens of thousands of Yazidi minorities had been forced into mountains, where they're stranded without food and water. Up to 60 children are among those who have died from the extreme conditions. Thousands of Yazidis rescued, Iraqi Human Rights Ministry spokesman says . Dehydration or massacre: Thousands caught in ISIS chokehold . The militant group executes civilians who don't adhere to its version of Sunni Islam. Its goal is to create an Islamic caliphate, which it claims it has already done, calling the regions they control in Iraq and Syria the Islamic State. Obama announced airstrikes to protect the hundreds of Americans working in the region and said humanitarian assistance to Kurdish minorities would be part of a limited mission that he described as a \"long-term project.\" But in Washington, Republicans harshly criticized the President and his mission, saying it is too little, too late. The U.S. role . \"ISIS continues to make gains everywhere,\" Republican Sen. John McCain said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Obama's approach to protect military and diplomatic personnel in the area, McCain said, is \"narrow\" in scope and \"clearly very, very ineffective, to say the least.\" \"That's not a strategy,\" he said, calling for additional airstrikes in Iraq and Syria to dismantle ISIS and to provide additional military equipment to the Kurds and the Syrian fighters who oppose ISIS. Officials: U.S. airstrikes pound ISIS militants firing at Iraq's Yazidis . That sentiment for an expanded involvement was echoed by Rep. Peter King, R-New York. \"I am saying we should do whatever we have to do,\" the House Homeland Security Committee member said on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" including, \"we take nothing off the table.\" On Sunday, Democrats, however, expressed support for the President's targeted airstrikes and cautioned against any broader involvement. \"Escalating it is not on the cards,\" Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, said on \"Meet the Press.\" \"We cannot send the troops. We must not send the troops.\" But King insisted his support for a broader operation, which includes \"massive aircraft,\" does not involve U.S. combat troops back into the country after nearly a decade of war and three years after the troops left. \"Let's not set up the false argument that there have to be troops on the ground,\" he said. The role of Iraqis . Democrats said Sunday that the U.S. can do little beyond provide humanitarian assistance and protect American personnel. They said it is ultimately up to Iraqis to address the crisis engulfing their country. \"Only Iraq can save Iraq,\" Durbin said. \"If Iraqis come together, al-Maliki put in power someone in power with the Shias and Kurds, perhaps they can do it themselves.\" The U.S. relationship with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki has deteriorated. He has been blamed for escalating tensions between religious and ethnic sects within Iraq between the Shia majority, the Sunni minority, the Kurds and smaller groups of minorities, causing the destabilization of the country. The Iraqi Parliament is expected to choose a new prime minister soon, and Democrats say that the new leader should unite the shattered country. Democrats say that political reconciliation in Baghdad would be able to address the crisis, which Sen. Ben Cardin, D- Maryland, called a \"civil war.\" \"The real cause is that the Iraqi government has not performed the way it should to protect the rights of all Iraqis,\" Cardin said on \"Fox news Sunday.\" Sen. Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, agreed that the U.S. is not responsible for repairing a country fraught with political divisions. \"This has to be a political strategy that takes place in Baghdad and not in Washington,\" he said on CBS News' \"Face the Nation.\" But King lambasted the Democrats, saying they are providing a limited view of Iraq and the threat of ISIS. He insisted that the problem is much deeper than intra-Iraq turmoil. Threat to the U.S. He called the Democrats' position, which is similar to the one Obama expressed this past week, a \"shameful abdication of American leadership.\" King said ISIS is a threat beyond Iraq and Syria, calling the group more powerful than al Qaeda was on September 11, 2001, when the U.S. was attacked. \"I want to hear what he says when they attack us in the United States,\" King said of ISIS. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, offered a similar, dire sentiment of the threat from the militant group shunned by al Qaeda because of its extreme, violent tactics. \"I think of an American city in flames because of the terrorist ability to operate in Syria and Iraq,\" he said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"Whatever you want to call these guys, they are coming here.\" Mideast spiraling in war and terror .

      "article": "Roman Polanski in October in Paris. The U.S. has asked Poland to extradite the director over an unlawful sex charge with a 13-year-old girl in 1977 . The U.S. has asked Poland to extradite filmmaker Roman Polanski over a 1977 child sex crime conviction, officials said on Wednesday. A lawyer for the director - viewed by many Poles as one of . their greatest living cultural figures - said Polish . prosecutors already questioned Polanski last year and let him go . free, and since then nothing had changed. Polanski, 81, who was born to Polish parents but lives in . France, has been spending time in the southern Polish city of . Krakow, where he is planning to shoot a film. Mateusz Martyniuk, a spokesman for the prosecutor general's . office in Warsaw, said the extradition request, which came from . prosecutors in Los Angeles, will be passed on to the . prosecutors' office in Krakow. 'Prosecutors will want to summon Polanski for questioning,' Martyniuk said. The spokesman said that as a rule Poland does not extradite its citizens. In October last year, prosecutors in Krakow interviewed . Polanski in connection with a U.S. warrant over the 1977 . conviction. They said there were no grounds to arrest him, and . they would await a U.S. extradition request before deciding on . any further steps. 'In our view no new circumstances have arisen which could . lead to a change in the decision by the prosecutor's office in . October,' one of Polanski's Polish lawyers, Jerzy Stachowicz, . told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday. The filmmaker pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sex . with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer during a photoshoot in Los . Angeles, fuelled by champagne and drugs. Polanski served 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea . bargain. He fled the United States the following year, believing . the judge hearing his case could overrule the deal and put him . in jail for years. In 2009, Polanski was arrested in the Swiss city of Zurich . on the U.S. warrant and placed under house arrest. He was freed . in 2010 after Swiss authorities decided not to extradite him to . the United States.

The U.S. has asked Poland to extradite the director over an unlawful sex charge with a 13-year-old girl in 1977 . The U.S. has asked Poland to extradite filmmaker Roman Polanski over a 1977 child sex crime conviction, officials said on Wednesday. A lawyer for the director - viewed by many Poles as one of . their greatest living cultural figures - said Polish . prosecutors already questioned Polanski last year and let him go . free, and since then nothing had changed. Polanski, 81, who was born to Polish parents but lives in . France, has been spending time in the southern Polish city of . Krakow, where he is planning to shoot a film. Mateusz Martyniuk, a spokesman for the prosecutor general's . office in Warsaw, said the extradition request, which came from . prosecutors in Los Angeles, will be passed on to the . prosecutors' office in Krakow. 'Prosecutors will want to summon Polanski for questioning,' Martyniuk said. The spokesman said that as a rule Poland does not extradite its citizens. In October last year, prosecutors in Krakow interviewed . Polanski in connection with a U.S. warrant over the 1977 . conviction. They said there were no grounds to arrest him, and . they would await a U.S. extradition request before deciding on . any further steps. 'In our view no new circumstances have arisen which could . lead to a change in the decision by the prosecutor's office in . October,' one of Polanski's Polish lawyers, Jerzy Stachowicz, . told Reuters by telephone on Wednesday. The filmmaker pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sex . with 13-year-old Samantha Geimer during a photoshoot in Los . Angeles, fuelled by champagne and drugs. Polanski served 42 days in jail as part of a 90-day plea . bargain. He fled the United States the following year, believing . the judge hearing his case could overrule the deal and put him . in jail for years. In 2009, Polanski was arrested in the Swiss city of Zurich . on the U.S. warrant and placed under house arrest. He was freed . in 2010 after Swiss authorities decided not to extradite him to . the United States. His lawyers have been seeking assurances from the Polish . authorities that he can travel freely back and forth to Krakow . to work on the film project, about the 19th-century Dreyfus . affair, without risking another arrest.

      "article": "Detained: Bradley Manning is escorted from the courthouse in Maryland today . Defence attorneys for Bradley Manning, the young soldier accused of leaking government secrets, revealed today that Manning, a gay soldier in the era of ‚öÑ≤don't ask, don't tell,' had an alter-ego named Breanna Manning. In the pre-trial hearing, his lawyers claim gender identity disorder played a role in Manning's mental and emotional problems that should have barred him from having access to sensitive material. They said they found medical information about female hormone treatments in Manning's room in Baghdad. While prosecutors objected to the line of questioning, Manning's military attorney Major Matthew Kemkes said Manning's gender identity disorder and homosexuality was paramount, because it would show 'what was going on in my client's mind. Manning, 24, is accused of leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive items to the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks. The leaked secrets include Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, State Department cables and a classified military video of a 2007 American helicopter attack in Iraq that killed 11 unarmed men, including a Reuters news photographer and his driver. The Obama administration says the released information has threatened valuable military and diplomatic sources and strained America's relations with other governments. Manning's lawyers argue that much of the information that was classified by the Pentagon posed no risk. Turning the guns: The young soldier's lawyer immediately turned fire against the investigating officer - claiming the proceedings were biased against Manning . The military is conducting a hearing at an Army post outside Washington to determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to bring Manning to trial, where he could face a term of life in prison as a traitor. An intelligence officer who worked with Manning said today that the soldier was considered to have an especially high understanding of enemy threats in Iraq and had to be trusted to keep the material he saw private. The description of Private Manning came at the beginning of the third day of the military hearing. Captain Casey Fulton testified for the prosecution that Manning had a 'top secret' security clearance, enabling him to view a wide range of classified material. None of the material posted on WikiLeaks was classified higher than 'secret'. Fulton said Manning was regarded as having a . better understanding than other analysts of enemy threats in Iraq. She . said analysts such as Manning, known as all-source analysts, were . trained to gather intelligence from a wide array of . sources. Fulton said analysts are trained not . to disclose classified information and are not allowed to burn . classified information onto CDs for personal use. But she said it was . impossible to supervise them 100 per cent of the time. 'You have to trust that they'll safeguard the material the way that they've been taught,' she said.. Accused: Bradley Manning, 24, is blamed for the largest leak of state secrets in American history . Military court: U.S. Army courtroom sketch shows a member of the prosecution team speaking during the hearing of Bradley Manning in at Fort Meade in Maryland . Army criminal investigators described . evidence they collected that links Manning to the WikiLeaks website's . collection of U.S. military and diplomatic secrets. Among the first issues to arise on Saturday was whether Manning's sexual orientation is relevant to the case against him. The . basis for the charges Manning faces are transcripts of online chats . with a confidant-turned-government-informant in which Manning allegedly . confesses his ties to WikiLeaks and also reveals he is gay. Maj . Kemkes asked Special Agent Toni Graham, an Army criminal investigator, . whether she had talked to people who believed Manning was gay or found . evidence among his belongings relating to gender-identity disorder. The condition often is described as a mental diagnosis in which people believe they were born the wrong sex. Graham said such questions were irrelevant to the investigation. 'We already knew before we arrived that Pfc. Manning was a homosexual,' Graham said. Prosecutors objected several times to the questions. Kemkes responded that if the government can argue that Manning intended to leak secrets, 'what is going on in my client's mind is very important.' During its cross examination of Graham, Manning's defense team also sought to convince the court that not all of the material he is accused of leaking is classified. Graham, who collected evidence from Manning's living quarters and workplace, testified that among the items seized was a DVD marked 'secret' that contained a military video showing the 2007 incident in which Apache attack helicopters gunned down unarmed men in Iraq. The video was taken from the . cockpit of one the helicopters. WikiLeaks posted the video in April . 2010, sparking questions about the military's rules of engagement and whether more needed to be done to . prevent civilian casualties. The gunners can be heard laughing and . referring to the men as 'dead bastards.' Kemkes, one of Manning's lawyers, . asked Graham whether she knew the video was unclassified. She said she . didn't. 'In fact, it was an unclassified video,' Kemkes said. Emotional turmoil: Manning's lawyers say he was a gay soldier at a time when homosexuals were barred from serving openly . Although WikiLeaks had been . posting sensitive information to the Web since 2006, release of the . Apache video drew worldwide attention to the organization as it prepared . to publish secret documents on the war in Afghanistan. Manning's appearances Friday and . Saturday in the Fort Meade courtroom mark the first time he has been . seen in public after 19 months in detention. The Oklahoma native comes to court in . Army camouflage fatigues and wearing dark-rimmed glasses. Slight and . serious, he takes notes during the proceedings. An Army appeals court on Friday . rejected a defense effort to have the presiding officer, Lt. Col. Paul . Almanza, because of alleged bias. Separately, lawyers for WikiLeaks and . founder Julian Assange are asking the military's highest appeals court . to guarantee two seats in the Fort Meade courtroom. Manning's hearing is open to the . public, with limited seating. Inside the courtroom, no civilian . recording equipment is allowed. Instead of a judge, a presiding . officer delivers a recommendation as to whether prosecutors have enough . evidence to bring a suspect to trial. A military commander then makes the final decision. Manning supporters: Hundreds of demonstrators march in support of Bradley Manning outside his military court hearing in Fort Meade on Saturday . In protest: Chris Hager of Falls Church, Virginia (right) dressed as Guantanamo detainee outside the opening of WikiLeaks suspect Bradley Manning's pre-trial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland . Defiant: A demonstrator carrying an image of soldier Bradley Manning, marches with hundreds of others outside Fort Meade in Maryland today . The case has spawned an . international support network of people who believe the U.S. government . has gone too far in seeking to punish Manning. More than 100 people gathered . outside Fort Meade for a march in support of Manning, some holding signs . declaring 'Americans have the right to know,' 'Free Bradley Manning' and 'Blowing the whistle on war crimes is not a crime.' Todd Anderson, 64, said he drove from New York City to take part. 'I think this man showed a great deal . of courage, the kind of thing I wouldn't have the courage to do, and I . really consider him to be a hero,\" Anderson said.

A study has found that marrying later in life is financially beneficial for women, but not for men. The University of Virginia has published a report that college-educated women who wed in their thirties earn an average of 56per cent more than those who get married a decade earlier. Conversely, men who settle down in their twenties have higher incomes than those who wait until after 30, no matter their education. The National Marriage Project's study, entitled Knot Yet: The Benefits and Costs of Delayed Marriage in America, examines the consequences of marrying later, a growing trend in the U.S. It notes that the average age of marriage is at an all-time high of 27 for women and 29 for men, compared to 1990 when the averages were 23 for women and 26 for men. But while women have actually benefited financially from delayed marriages, men who wed earlier in life tend to be more successful later on. The study says that childbirth plays a role in these results. Around two-thirds of lifetime income growth takes . place during the first ten years of a career, according to clinical psychologist Meg Jay. Since college-educated women who marry in their twenties also tend to have their first baby earlier, forcing them to take a break from their careers, they can take longer to climb the corporate ladder. But getting hitched at a younger age tends to be a good career move for men, perhaps because married men 'are more sure of themselves compared to single men,' leading to more productivity, suggests Business Insider. Not all women who wait until their thirties to get married reap the benefits, however.

A Guatemalan woman seeking asylum based on her belief that she would not be safe in her native country will have her case reviewed, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday. Lesly Yajayra Perdomo, a native of Guatemala who entered the United States illegally as a teenager to join her mother in 1991, was facing deporation in 2003. She requested asylum \"because she feared persecution as a member of a particular social group consisting of women between the ages of fourteen and forty,\" according to the court document. In particular, Perdomo argued that women in Guatemala \"were murdered at a high rate with impunity.\" An immigration judge denied her claim, and the Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the decision. Monday's ruling remands the case to the BIA for further proceedings. Perdomo, who lives in Reno, Nevada, and works as a Medicaid account executive at a medical facility there, is not assured asylum, but the decision gives her and countless other Guatemalan women the possibility of remaining in the United States. A key issue in the case is whether Guatemalan women are too broad of a group to be considered a protected \"particular social group\" eligible for asylum. That's what the BIA decided when it upheld the immigration judge's ruling, calling it \"merely a demographic division ... rather than a particular social group.\" The three-judge panel at the appeals court, however, found that the decision was \"inconsistent with its own precedent and this court's case law.\" It is important to note that the appeals court stopped short of saying Perdomo deserved asylum, only saying that she was eligible for it, Kevin Johnson, Dean of the University of California-Davis Law School, told CNN. Proving that Perdomo will face persecution if she is returned to Guatemala and that the country doesn't protect its young women will be hard to prove, he said. Any other Guatemalan women hoping to take advantage of this week's ruling will have to do the same. \"I don't think there's going to be a flood of Guatemalan women applying for asylum tomorrow,\" Johnson said. \"This is part of a trend among U.S. courts to ensure women are afforded protection under asylum laws.\" According to Amnesty International, between 2001 and 2006, more than 1,900 Guatemalan women and girls were killed.

      "article": "(CNN) -- NATO representatives and lawmakers from alliance nations will meet in Iceland Thursday to discuss security challenges that are likely to arise as the Arctic Circle thaws. Global warming is opening up more parts of the Arctic to development and raising security concerns. The area -- one of the planet's most fragile and pristine ecosystems -- sits atop a bounty of untapped fossil fuels. And as the melting polar ice makes the Arctic more accessible to ships, several countries are scrambling to claim jurisdiction in the area. \"The economic interests are reflected in ... competing claims by relevant stakeholders, and resumed military presence in the area,\" NATO said on its Web site. \"As it is a region of enduring strategic importance for NATO and allied security, developments in the High North require careful and ongoing examination.\" The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that 90 billion barrels of oil, 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids and 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas are recoverable in the frozen region north of the Arctic Circle. At the same time, Arctic water is warming so quickly that the entire region could be ice-free by 2013. Already Russia, Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Finland are fighting to lay claim to the Arctic's icy real estate. Unlike Antarctica, which has a treaty that prohibits territorial claims, there is no agreement for the vast expanse of the Arctic. So questions about drilling rights and shipping lanes are somewhat murky. According to the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, countries are entitled to exclusive economic zones up to 200 miles from their shores. But some countries are trying to extend that zone. Russian scientists want to prove the seabed below the North Pole is part of the Eurasian continental shelf, an area called the Lomonosov Ridge. If that is the case, the region would be under Russian control. Moscow argued before a U.N. commission in 2001 that the ridge is an extension of its continental territory. But the United Nations asked for more evidence. Danish scientists are trying to prove that the Lomonosov Ridge is connected to Greenland, and Canadian scientists are looking for links between the ridge and Ellesmere Island, a Canadian territory.

Global warming is opening up more parts of the Arctic to development and raising security concerns. The area -- one of the planet's most fragile and pristine ecosystems -- sits atop a bounty of untapped fossil fuels. And as the melting polar ice makes the Arctic more accessible to ships, several countries are scrambling to claim jurisdiction in the area. \"The economic interests are reflected in ... competing claims by relevant stakeholders, and resumed military presence in the area,\" NATO said on its Web site. \"As it is a region of enduring strategic importance for NATO and allied security, developments in the High North require careful and ongoing examination.\" The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that 90 billion barrels of oil, 44 billion barrels of natural gas liquids and 1,670 trillion cubic feet of natural gas are recoverable in the frozen region north of the Arctic Circle. At the same time, Arctic water is warming so quickly that the entire region could be ice-free by 2013. Already Russia, Canada, the United States, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland and Finland are fighting to lay claim to the Arctic's icy real estate. Unlike Antarctica, which has a treaty that prohibits territorial claims, there is no agreement for the vast expanse of the Arctic. So questions about drilling rights and shipping lanes are somewhat murky. According to the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, countries are entitled to exclusive economic zones up to 200 miles from their shores. But some countries are trying to extend that zone. Russian scientists want to prove the seabed below the North Pole is part of the Eurasian continental shelf, an area called the Lomonosov Ridge. If that is the case, the region would be under Russian control. Moscow argued before a U.N. commission in 2001 that the ridge is an extension of its continental territory. But the United Nations asked for more evidence. Danish scientists are trying to prove that the Lomonosov Ridge is connected to Greenland, and Canadian scientists are looking for links between the ridge and Ellesmere Island, a Canadian territory. NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer will attend the two-day conference in Reykjavek.\nSummary:\n",

It is unusual for a member of Congress to tell the high court how it should vote on a case during the weeks that the justices are crafting their opinion. Oral arguments were held in late March, and the court has been quietly working behind the scenes. An opinion is expected by late June. The Vermont Democrat attended the three-day oral arguments at the Supreme Court. Leahy offered tepid praise for Robert's leadership but was critical of the chief justice's fellow conservative benchmates. \"I was struck by how little respect some of the justices showed to Congress, and of how dismissive they were of the months of work in hearings and committee actions and debate of amendments and motions and points of order on the Senate and House floors before the measure was enacted.\" Leahy was also tough on his GOP colleagues. He pointed out that Republican opponents lost in Congress in 2008, saying that helped lead to passage of the ACA two years later with the strong backing of Obama. \"Now they want conservative activists on the Supreme Court to intervene and turn their policy disagreements into law by reading them into the Constitution. That is wrong.\" The chairman gave no direct indication whether he thought the law was in danger of being overturned by the court, which has 5-4 conservative majority.

It is unusual for a member of Congress to tell the high court how it should vote on a case during the weeks that the justices are crafting their opinion. Oral arguments were held in late March, and the court has been quietly working behind the scenes. An opinion is expected by late June. The Vermont Democrat attended the three-day oral arguments at the Supreme Court. Leahy offered tepid praise for Robert's leadership but was critical of the chief justice's fellow conservative benchmates. \"I was struck by how little respect some of the justices showed to Congress, and of how dismissive they were of the months of work in hearings and committee actions and debate of amendments and motions and points of order on the Senate and House floors before the measure was enacted.\" Leahy was also tough on his GOP colleagues. He pointed out that Republican opponents lost in Congress in 2008, saying that helped lead to passage of the ACA two years later with the strong backing of Obama. \"Now they want conservative activists on the Supreme Court to intervene and turn their policy disagreements into law by reading them into the Constitution. That is wrong.\" The chairman gave no direct indication whether he thought the law was in danger of being overturned by the court, which has 5-4 conservative majority. The high court is certain to have no response to the statements of Leahy or any other lawmaker. The court will next be heard on the health care law when a ruling is issued, the timing of which will not be announced in advance.\nSummary:\n",

      "article": "Reluctant approval from Congress for providing military support to Syrian rebels allows the Obama administration to move forward with plans first announced almost six weeks ago. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters on Tuesday that the goal of the military aid expected to include small arms, ammunition and perhaps anti-tank weapons is to keep the Syrian opposition going against forces aligned with President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Noting al-Assad's forces have been helped by Hezbollah in Lebanon as well as Iran, Carney said Syrian rebels need the help of the United States and allied nations to withstand an increased assault. \"The aid is intended to help the opposition resist Assad and eventually prevail,\" Carney said, adding that any resolution of Syria's civil war will require a political transition. His comment appeared intended to soften any expectations that the rebels could topple the regime by military means alone. A source, speaking on condition of being identified only as an official, said Monday that President Barack Obama can begin acting on plans for increased Syrian aid first made public last month now that concerns of Congress had been resolved. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Mike Rogers said Monday that his panel agreed to the administration's plan for military aid despite reservations about its chances for success. \"After much discussion and review, we got a consensus that we could move forward with what the administration's plans and intentions are in Syria consistent with committee reservations,\" the Michigan Republican said. At a congressional hearing on Tuesday on next year's defense budget, GOP Rep. Rich Nugent of Florida said he worried that arming Syria rebels today could mean his sons in the military might face those weapons in the future, if they fall into the wrong hands. \"We want to make sure that we don't put our sons or daughters in any jeopardy particularly as it relates to arming those that we have no idea who they are,\" Nugent said. The Obama administration has been reluctant to enter another military engagement, but announced on June 13 that it would provide military support to rebel fighters because al-Assad's forces had used chemical weapons. Its plans so far stop short of calls by some in Congress, such as veteran Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, to establish a \"no-fly\" zone over Syria. In a letter released Monday, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey warned U.S. military involvement would likely cost billions of dollars and include a range of risks for the forces involved. Eddie Izzard: In Syrian refugee camps, another day of childhood is lost . \"It is no less than an act of war,\" Dempsey wrote to Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee. The United States has learned from the past 10 years \"that it is not enough to simply alter the balance of military power without careful consideration of what is necessary in order to preserve a functioning state,\" Dempsey's letter said in apparent reference to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Syrian opposition questions Taliban rebel role . McCain, who has long advocated arming Syrian rebels, said Tuesday he was disappointed by Dempsey's letter. \"Most military experts that I know totally disagree\" with Dempsey's assessment of the size of the task and U.S. capabilities, McCain said. \"The question should be is the status quo acceptable and obviously that is not.\" Last month, McCain called for taking out al-Assad's air assets to create a safe zone for the Syrian opposition. \"I know that we have the military capability to impose a 'no-fly' zone, to crater their runways and their fixed installations where fuel and parts are, and establish a 'no-fly' zone with Patriot missiles,\" McCain said in June. \"And if we can't do that, then the question ought to be asked to the American taxpayer, to the Pentagon, 'What in the world are we wasting tens of billions of dollars for defense for if we can't even take care of this situation?'\" McCain said. Dempsey: Syria intervention is \"act of war\" that could cost billions . More than 100,000 people have been killed since the Syrian crisis began in March 2011, while refugees fleeing the conflict threaten to overtax government services and destabilize neighboring Jordan. In Washington, Secretary of State John Kerry met Tuesday with U.N. agencies and other international aid organizations to discuss challenges to addressing what he called a humanitarian crisis. \"We are having a very difficult time being able to access people, move people directly and protect people so we intend to have a very solid, in-depth discussion today about creative ways that we can meet our obligations to human beings who are in huge danger and distress,\" Kerry said. He noted his visit this week to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan where he said he witnessed \"the dramatic and unbelievably moving ways in which people are separated from homes and family, so many people murdered and killed in massacres and yet somehow these people try to pull themselves together.\" Sources: U.S. to send small arms, ammo to Syrian rebels .",

Five high school football players have been charged with the gang-rape of a 16-year-old girl after she was able to record part of her ordeal on her iPod. Of the five underage boys, all aged between 16 and 17 and on the football team at Winter Springs High School in Seminole County, Florida, two are now being prosecuted as adults and three will face court as juveniles. A sixth suspect, 18-year-old Torreano Batton, has not been charged but is due back in adult court this afternoon for his arraignment. The delay came after prosecutors asked for more time to make a decision, the Orlando Sentinel reports. The six suspects were arrested last November after a 16-year-old girl told police they sexually assaulted her in woods close to Winter Springs High School. She was allegedly raped by three of them as she walked from school to a nearby McDonald's through a small patch of woods on November 13. Batton and two others trapped her and refused to allow her to leave until she performed sex acts on each of them, prosecutors said. Then, as she was leaving McDonald's, the suspects are alleged to have dragged her back into the woods where four of them forced her to perform sex acts. Two suspects assaulted her twice, she said. The girl used her iPod to film part of what happened to her. The recording is said to show the suspects ordering her to perform sex acts and insisting she submit because it is one boy's 17th birthday. According to a police report seen by the Orlando Sentinel: 'The males are circling her and appear to be trying to intimidate her into performing the acts and keeping her from leaving.' The recording shows the victim answering 'No' and telling her attackers she wants to go back to school, the report says. Two of the underage suspects denied being involved, while the other three insisted the sex was consensual. Batton also denied involvement. Of the five underage boys, all aged between 16 and 17 and on the football team at Winter Springs High School in Seminole County, pictured, two are now being prosecuted as adults and three will face court as juveniles . If convicted, the three suspects charged as juveniles could be placed in a juvenile prison until they are 19 years old. The two juveniles charged as adults face a maximum of four years in the adult prison system as 'youthful offenders'. Batton, if charged and found guilty as an adult, faces a potential maximum sentence of 30 years. Four of the underage suspects are from Sanford and the fifth is from Winter Springs, where Batton is also from. Batton was freed on a £35,000 bond after more than three weeks in jail, ordered to wear a GPS tag and to stay away from Winter Springs High School.",

      "article": "An obese father who was told to give up fast food or lose his kids by his fianc‚àöe because she feared he would eat himself to death has slimmed down to 16 stone. Michael Wareing, 40, from Glasgow, who wore a size XXXXXL, loved to eat kebabs with ‚öÑ≤all the trimmings' at least once a day and spent £200 a month on takeaways. He gained 20 stone between 2005 and 2008, after having two children with his fianc‚àöe April Roy, 31, taking him to an unhealthy 30 stone. Michael Waring, 40 from Glasgow, weighed 30 stone, left, before getting a gastric sleeve fitted and losing an amazing 16 stone, pictured right . Mr Waring and Miss Roy now relish the time they can now spend together playing with the kids in the park . However, April said Michael's weight gain meant he didn't help out around the house or looking after Kieran-Lee, now 11, and Liam, nine, and became a ‚öÑ≤huge strain' on their relationship, so she gave him an ultimatum. Mother-of-four April moved into a flat near the family home, but Michael continued to comfort eat – it was then he had gastric sleeve surgery and finally managed to ditch the pounds and win back his family. April said: ‚öÑ≤I was scared it was putting his life at risk and he'd miss our boys grow up. I told him I was moving me and the boys out. I didn't want them to see him this way. ‚öÑ≤He had to pick the kebabs or his kids – keep gaining weight and lose us or diet and put his family first.' In a bid to win back his family, Michael swapped fatty foods for salads, pasta and fish dishes and kept a food diary. Michael continued to see his sons every weekend, and April rang his mother Janet Wareing regularly to find out his progress. Thw family can all now enjoy days out together. Miss Roy says that the gastric sleeve surgery was a lifesaver: 'I couldn't be happier. Surgery saved his life and his family.' Mr Wareing couldn't go out and play with his kids as he would be exhausted after five minutes . April said: ‚öÑ≤I didn't want to call Michael too much in case he thought I was nagging him. ‚öÑ≤Janet told me he was eating healthy and going for walks but he was miserable. When I saw him, he said he was practically starving himself to lose weight for us. ‚öÑ≤But it wasn't working and he confessed being alone upset him and he comfort ate.' April said: ‚öÑ≤Janet had seen a TV show about weight loss surgery and thought it could help Michael.' Michael - who has since had another son and a daughter with April - agreed to go to a Phoenix Health weight loss clinic where a consultant talked him through his options. In August 2010, two weeks after Michael's consultation, he was fitted with a gastric sleeve. The couple started dating in 2003 when they were introduced through Mr Wareing's brother. April revealed that when they had their son Kieren-Lee, Michael was a hands-on dad – but it all changed after he put on weight. Michael and his sons Liam & Kieren-Lee standing in his trousers he wore when he was fat . Michael pictured with his partner April and new born Kaevy-Anne in hospital . She said: ‚öÑ≤Michael was a great dad. He loved bath-times and putting the boys to bed. ‚öÑ≤He got up in the night when they woke up crying and rocked them back to sleep. ‚öÑ≤When Kieren-Lee was bigger, Michael played toy soldiers with him. He loved taking him to the swings or for walks on the beach.' But in 2005, Mr Wareing became a different person. April said: ‚öÑ≤He was more reserved and didn't want to talk about his feelings. I imagined he was missing his other three kids who lived with their mums. ‚öÑ≤So he comfort ate crisps and chocolate. His favourite takeaway was kebabs with all the trimmings.' A year later, the couple had their second son Liam, now nine. Michael gained so much weight he struggled to help around the couple's house and look after their children. Michael said: ‚öÑ≤I got upset that I couldn't go out with them and I was how I was. It was unfair on the kids.' Michael with his children pictured outside a takeaway - which was his weakness before losing weight . Mid-way through his weight loss, Mr Wareing was already showing signs of a dramatic change . April said: ‚öÑ≤He wasn't 11 stone anymore. He couldn't come for walks to the park with us. After five minutes, he'd be exhausted and say his knees hurt. ‚öÑ≤All he could do with our sons was watch TV. I told him I was worried about his weight but it didn't work.' By 2008, Mr Wareing had gained 20 stone and wore XXXXXL jeans. April said: ‚öÑ≤It put a huge strain on our relationship but he didn't talk about his weight. I had to get him to change his ways.' In summer 2008 Miss Roy gave him an ultimatum. She said: ‚öÑ≤He had to pick the kebabs or his kids. ‚öÑ∫He was upset but we'd talked about his weight before so I knew he understood I was doing it for all of us. I said I loved him but I'd had enough.' Abandoned by his family, it was the push Michael needed. The gastric sleeve procedure meant he could only eat small portions or liquids like soup. April said: ‚öÑ≤He said his lunch looked like baby food, but it worked.' Soon Michael was swapping his old clothes for new, smaller-sized tops and trousers. As the pounds disappeared Mr Wareing found that he could go and and play with his kids like he used to . Michael on the swing, playing with his family in the park . She said: ‚öÑ≤He had the energy to run around the park and play football with them. We got on better and four months later, got back together.' In December 2010, April fell pregnant again and was able to wear Michael's old clothes as maternity wear when she was six months pregnant. In August 2011, Michael – who by now had lost 16 stone – had a gastric bypass to help him lose more weight. Kieren-Lee and Liam could now stand up in their father's jeans, one in each leg. April said: ‚öÑ≤They were so big they called them Daddy's Tents.' In September 2011, the couple's daughter, Kaevyanne, was born and in October Michael proposed. Michael now works as a kitchen porter in a takeaway. April said: ‚öÑ≤Michael can still eat kebabs but they need to be much smaller and the meat has to be dry, not greasy or fatty.' In December 2014, Miss Roy gave birth to the couple's third son Arran and are now planning their wedding. Mr Wareing is now more involved in his bringing up the children. He said: ‚öÑ≤I have a lot more energy now so I can go out and play with the kids. I take the dog out. I walk everywhere. ‚öÑ≤I'm a lot happier and feel more confident. April and my mum gave me a boost, and losing weight changed my life. Now I look back and think, why did I let myself go?' Miss Roy cannot believe the life-changing results of the operation. Miss Roy said: ‚öÑ≤I'm so proud of Michael and couldn't be happier. Surgery saved his life and his family.'",

Michael Wareing, 40, from Glasgow, who wore a size XXXXXL, loved to eat kebabs with ‚öÑ≤all the trimmings' at least once a day and spent £200 a month on takeaways. He gained 20 stone between 2005 and 2008, after having two children with his fianc‚àöe April Roy, 31, taking him to an unhealthy 30 stone. Michael Waring, 40 from Glasgow, weighed 30 stone, left, before getting a gastric sleeve fitted and losing an amazing 16 stone, pictured right . Mr Waring and Miss Roy now relish the time they can now spend together playing with the kids in the park . However, April said Michael's weight gain meant he didn't help out around the house or looking after Kieran-Lee, now 11, and Liam, nine, and became a ‚öÑ≤huge strain' on their relationship, so she gave him an ultimatum. Mother-of-four April moved into a flat near the family home, but Michael continued to comfort eat – it was then he had gastric sleeve surgery and finally managed to ditch the pounds and win back his family. April said: ‚öÑ≤I was scared it was putting his life at risk and he'd miss our boys grow up. I told him I was moving me and the boys out. I didn't want them to see him this way. ‚öÑ≤He had to pick the kebabs or his kids – keep gaining weight and lose us or diet and put his family first.' In a bid to win back his family, Michael swapped fatty foods for salads, pasta and fish dishes and kept a food diary. Michael continued to see his sons every weekend, and April rang his mother Janet Wareing regularly to find out his progress. Thw family can all now enjoy days out together. Miss Roy says that the gastric sleeve surgery was a lifesaver: 'I couldn't be happier. Surgery saved his life and his family.' Mr Wareing couldn't go out and play with his kids as he would be exhausted after five minutes . April said: ‚öÑ≤I didn't want to call Michael too much in case he thought I was nagging him. ‚öÑ≤Janet told me he was eating healthy and going for walks but he was miserable. When I saw him, he said he was practically starving himself to lose weight for us. ‚öÑ≤But it wasn't working and he confessed being alone upset him and he comfort ate.' April said: ‚öÑ≤Janet had seen a TV show about weight loss surgery and thought it could help Michael.' Michael - who has since had another son and a daughter with April - agreed to go to a Phoenix Health weight loss clinic where a consultant talked him through his options. In August 2010, two weeks after Michael's consultation, he was fitted with a gastric sleeve. The couple started dating in 2003 when they were introduced through Mr Wareing's brother. April revealed that when they had their son Kieren-Lee, Michael was a hands-on dad – but it all changed after he put on weight. Michael and his sons Liam & Kieren-Lee standing in his trousers he wore when he was fat . Michael pictured with his partner April and new born Kaevy-Anne in hospital . She said: ‚öÑ≤Michael was a great dad. He loved bath-times and putting the boys to bed. ‚öÑ≤He got up in the night when they woke up crying and rocked them back to sleep. ‚öÑ≤When Kieren-Lee was bigger, Michael played toy soldiers with him. He loved taking him to the swings or for walks on the beach.' But in 2005, Mr Wareing became a different person. April said: ‚öÑ≤He was more reserved and didn't want to talk about his feelings. I imagined he was missing his other three kids who lived with their mums. ‚öÑ≤So he comfort ate crisps and chocolate. His favourite takeaway was kebabs with all the trimmings.' A year later, the couple had their second son Liam, now nine. Michael gained so much weight he struggled to help around the couple's house and look after their children. Michael said: ‚öÑ≤I got upset that I couldn't go out with them and I was how I was. It was unfair on the kids.' Michael with his children pictured outside a takeaway - which was his weakness before losing weight . Mid-way through his weight loss, Mr Wareing was already showing signs of a dramatic change . April said: ‚öÑ≤He wasn't 11 stone anymore. He couldn't come for walks to the park with us. After five minutes, he'd be exhausted and say his knees hurt. ‚öÑ≤All he could do with our sons was watch TV. I told him I was worried about his weight but it didn't work.' By 2008, Mr Wareing had gained 20 stone and wore XXXXXL jeans. April said: ‚öÑ≤It put a huge strain on our relationship but he didn't talk about his weight. I had to get him to change his ways.' In summer 2008 Miss Roy gave him an ultimatum. She said: ‚öÑ≤He had to pick the kebabs or his kids. ‚öÑ∫He was upset but we'd talked about his weight before so I knew he understood I was doing it for all of us. I said I loved him but I'd had enough.' Abandoned by his family, it was the push Michael needed. The gastric sleeve procedure meant he could only eat small portions or liquids like soup. April said: ‚öÑ≤He said his lunch looked like baby food, but it worked.' Soon Michael was swapping his old clothes for new, smaller-sized tops and trousers. As the pounds disappeared Mr Wareing found that he could go and and play with his kids like he used to . Michael on the swing, playing with his family in the park . She said: ‚öÑ≤He had the energy to run around the park and play football with them. We got on better and four months later, got back together.' In December 2010, April fell pregnant again and was able to wear Michael's old clothes as maternity wear when she was six months pregnant. In August 2011, Michael – who by now had lost 16 stone – had a gastric bypass to help him lose more weight. Kieren-Lee and Liam could now stand up in their father's jeans, one in each leg. April said: ‚öÑ≤They were so big they called them Daddy's Tents.' In September 2011, the couple's daughter, Kaevyanne, was born and in October Michael proposed. Michael now works as a kitchen porter in a takeaway. April said: ‚öÑ≤Michael can still eat kebabs but they need to be much smaller and the meat has to be dry, not greasy or fatty.' In December 2014, Miss Roy gave birth to the couple's third son Arran and are now planning their wedding. Mr Wareing is now more involved in his bringing up the children. He said: ‚öÑ≤I have a lot more energy now so I can go out and play with the kids. I take the dog out. I walk everywhere. ‚öÑ≤I'm a lot happier and feel more confident. April and my mum gave me a boost, and losing weight changed my life. Now I look back and think, why did I let myself go?' Miss Roy cannot believe the life-changing results of the operation. Miss Roy said: ‚öÑ≤I'm so proud of Michael and couldn't be happier. Surgery saved his life and his family.'\nSummary:\n",

      "article": "(CNN) --  The hotel that will be home to President-elect Barack Obama and his family for the next couple of weeks offers one of Washington's best views of their future home, the White House, and a past linked with political movers and shakers. The Obama family will check into the historic Hay-Adams hotel in Washington this weekend. The Obamas will be moving into the Hay-Adams hotel this weekend, aides say. They're doing this in part so that the family's daughters, Sasha and Malia, can begin school when classes reconvene after winter break. They had hoped to move earlier into nearby Blair House, which presidents-elect traditionally occupy five days before moving into the White House. But the Bush administration said the house, which is used as a guest house for visiting dignitaries, already had events scheduled there and guests who could not be displaced. The Obamas will move into Blair House on January 15. According to its Web site, the Hay-Adams takes its name from past residents of the site -- one of whom had close ties with Obama's favorite U.S. president, Abraham Lincoln. John Hay, a private assistant to Lincoln and later secretary of state, and Henry Adams, an author and descendent of presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, both lived on the site the hotel now occupies. The two, their wives and geologist Clarence King were a group of friends that dubbed themselves \"The Five of Hearts,\" going so far as to have china and stationary letterhead printed with the nickname. In 1884, Hay and Adams bought adjoining lots at the corner of 16th and H Streets, and their homes became Washington's leading salons. Their discussions of politics, literature, science and art attracted the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain and author Henry James. The homes were bought and razed in 1927, with the Italian Renaissance-style Hay-Adams House erected in their place at a cost of $900,000. It was bought by the Ieu family of Japan in 1989 and was closed from October 2001 to March 2002, during which time it underwent a $20 million renovation. Watch more about the Obamas' temporary home  . The hotel sits across Lafayette Square from the White House. It has 145 guest units, including 21 suites. Its Web site advertises rooms with unobstructed views of the White House, St. John's Church and the square. Local legend holds that Henry Adams' wife, Clover, committed suicide in 1885 and now haunts the hotel. The story goes that she appears most frequently in December on the hotel's fourth floor. The Hay-Adams' roof is frequently used by film crews when an aerial view of the White House is needed.",

The Obama family will check into the historic Hay-Adams hotel in Washington this weekend. The Obamas will be moving into the Hay-Adams hotel this weekend, aides say. They're doing this in part so that the family's daughters, Sasha and Malia, can begin school when classes reconvene after winter break. They had hoped to move earlier into nearby Blair House, which presidents-elect traditionally occupy five days before moving into the White House. But the Bush administration said the house, which is used as a guest house for visiting dignitaries, already had events scheduled there and guests who could not be displaced. The Obamas will move into Blair House on January 15. According to its Web site, the Hay-Adams takes its name from past residents of the site -- one of whom had close ties with Obama's favorite U.S. president, Abraham Lincoln. John Hay, a private assistant to Lincoln and later secretary of state, and Henry Adams, an author and descendent of presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams, both lived on the site the hotel now occupies. The two, their wives and geologist Clarence King were a group of friends that dubbed themselves \"The Five of Hearts,\" going so far as to have china and stationary letterhead printed with the nickname. In 1884, Hay and Adams bought adjoining lots at the corner of 16th and H Streets, and their homes became Washington's leading salons. Their discussions of politics, literature, science and art attracted the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, Mark Twain and author Henry James. The homes were bought and razed in 1927, with the Italian Renaissance-style Hay-Adams House erected in their place at a cost of $900,000. It was bought by the Ieu family of Japan in 1989 and was closed from October 2001 to March 2002, during which time it underwent a $20 million renovation. Watch more about the Obamas' temporary home  . The hotel sits across Lafayette Square from the White House. It has 145 guest units, including 21 suites. Its Web site advertises rooms with unobstructed views of the White House, St. John's Church and the square. Local legend holds that Henry Adams' wife, Clover, committed suicide in 1885 and now haunts the hotel. The story goes that she appears most frequently in December on the hotel's fourth floor. The Hay-Adams' roof is frequently used by film crews when an aerial view of the White House is needed.\nSummary:\n",

Liam Gallagher was today hit with a second $5,000 (£3,300) fine by a New York judge who said she was tired of his ‚öÑ≤frivolous conduct'. Judge Laura Drager said that she could not ‚öÑ≤excuse him any longer' and said his US child custody battle was going to trial. The lawyer for Liza Ghorbani, Mr Gallagher's baby mother, said that Mr Gallagher had not turned up for a deposition he was supposed to give last month either. Ira Garr also revealed that their daughter Gemma, two, is exhibiting ‚öÑ≤delays' in her development and is having problems with speech. With no settlement the case will now go to trial on March 26 with both sides digging their heels in. So far Mr Gallagher has only flown to America for one hearing in two years and was last month hit with his first $5,000 fine by Judge Drager. In the latest hearing she opened by asking Mr Gallagher's lawyer Raoul Felder: ‚öÑ≤Mr Felder, where is your client'. Mr Felder said: ‚öÑ≤My client is not here.' Judge Drager said: ‚öÑ≤Is there a reason why he is not here?' Mr Felder said: ‚öÑ≤I have no good reason'. Judge Drager said: ‚öÑ≤I am imposing a sanction of $5,000 for what I deem to be his frivolous conduct in not appearing in this court.... ‚öÑ≤...I had him appear by phone and I excused his (non) appearance but as we proceed to trial I cannot excuse his (non) appearance any longer. ‚öÑ≤There is no reason that I have been given as to why he cannot appear'. In his submission Mr Garr attacked Mr Gallagher for his ‚öÑ≤willful failure' to attend court. He ran through his litany of non appearances dating back to 2013 and said: ‚öÑ≤The history of non compliance is about the most flagrant I can consider'. Scroll down for video . Liza Ghorbani's lawyer said Mr Gallagher had not turned up for a deposition he was meant to give last month . Mr Garr also told the court that Mr Gallagher had never once even asked to see Gemma or requested visitation rights. Mr Felder however accused Miss Ghorbani of ‚öÑ≤greed'. He said that Mr Gallagher had been paying $5,000 a month to her for two years now even when there was no court order forcing him to do so. He said that with Miss Ghorbani: ‚öÑ≤It's a desire not to collect child support, it's a desire to get support for herself, to change her lifestyle. ‚öÑ≤She wants bodyguards, a doorman, she wants to be treated as maybe a wife is treated if it was a long marriage... ‚öÑ≤We are talking about greed here. If this was street talk I'd say the court was scammed'. He cast doubts on Miss Ghorbani's claims she was poor by pointing out that she lived a comfortable life and was taking Gemma to music lessons and baby ballet. Mr Gallagher met Miss Ghorbani when she interviewed him in 2010. At the time, he was married to singer Nicole Appleton (pictured together in 2005) He also claimed that she spent $2,000 a month on her apartment in Manhattan to retain the ‚öÑ≤fantasy' she was still living in the city when she was actually living with her parents in Virginia. In her ruling, Judge Drager rejected a motion by Mr Garr for the case to go into default, which would mean that the court would make a decision on how much Mr Gallagher should pay based on a per centage of his income. Miss Ghorbani is currently being paid $5,000 a month by Mr Gallagher until a final decision about child maintenance can be agreed. When Mr Felder raised the prospect of Mr Gallagher attending the trial the judge said: ‚öÑ≤That would be great!' Mr Gallagher, 41, met Miss Ghorbani, 40, after she interviewed him for the New York Times in 2010. At the time he was still married to All Saints singer Nicole Appleton with whom he is now divorced. Speaking after the hearing Mr Felder said that Mr Gallagher was in the UK but he did not know why he had not come to court. Asked if Mr Gallagher would attend the trial he said: ‚öÑ≤I don't know'. Mr Garr would not elaborate on the nature of Gemma's health problems but said that the ‚öÑ≤delays' were being monitored. A spokesman for Mr Gallagher said: 'We believed that the case was resolved on an extremely generous basis to the lady until we got to court when she apparently received advice from others that prevented this. 'Liam always wanted to be more than fair and has always accepted responsibility for the child. The lady and her advisors have not allowed this to happen.'",

Mr Garr also told the court that Mr Gallagher had never once even asked to see Gemma or requested visitation rights. Mr Felder however accused Miss Ghorbani of ‚öÑ≤greed'. He said that Mr Gallagher had been paying $5,000 a month to her for two years now even when there was no court order forcing him to do so. He said that with Miss Ghorbani: ‚öÑ≤It's a desire not to collect child support, it's a desire to get support for herself, to change her lifestyle. ‚öÑ≤She wants bodyguards, a doorman, she wants to be treated as maybe a wife is treated if it was a long marriage... ‚öÑ≤We are talking about greed here. If this was street talk I'd say the court was scammed'. He cast doubts on Miss Ghorbani's claims she was poor by pointing out that she lived a comfortable life and was taking Gemma to music lessons and baby ballet. Mr Gallagher met Miss Ghorbani when she interviewed him in 2010. At the time, he was married to singer Nicole Appleton (pictured together in 2005) He also claimed that she spent $2,000 a month on her apartment in Manhattan to retain the ‚öÑ≤fantasy' she was still living in the city when she was actually living with her parents in Virginia. In her ruling, Judge Drager rejected a motion by Mr Garr for the case to go into default, which would mean that the court would make a decision on how much Mr Gallagher should pay based on a per centage of his income. Miss Ghorbani is currently being paid $5,000 a month by Mr Gallagher until a final decision about child maintenance can be agreed. When Mr Felder raised the prospect of Mr Gallagher attending the trial the judge said: ‚öÑ≤That would be great!' Mr Gallagher, 41, met Miss Ghorbani, 40, after she interviewed him for the New York Times in 2010. At the time he was still married to All Saints singer Nicole Appleton with whom he is now divorced. Speaking after the hearing Mr Felder said that Mr Gallagher was in the UK but he did not know why he had not come to court. Asked if Mr Gallagher would attend the trial he said: ‚öÑ≤I don't know'. Mr Garr would not elaborate on the nature of Gemma's health problems but said that the ‚öÑ≤delays' were being monitored. A spokesman for Mr Gallagher said: 'We believed that the case was resolved on an extremely generous basis to the lady until we got to court when she apparently received advice from others that prevented this. 'Liam always wanted to be more than fair and has always accepted responsibility for the child. The lady and her advisors have not allowed this to happen.'\nSummary:\n",

She periodically asked the students what they were making. Some were unable to speak, others were squirming in their tiny chairs; several interrupted the playtime to use the bathroom. The children, ages 2 to 5, have one thing in common: They all have autism. \"We come in here in the morning not knowing what the day's going to hold,\" said Waldrop, who teaches at the Marcus Autism Center in Atlanta. \"We have to be really flexible about the stuff we do in the classroom.\" Waldrop, who's been on the job for five years, is one of three certified special education teachers in the Center's Early Intervention Program. Along with a group of assistants, the teachers spend the seven-hour school day moving from classroom to playroom to playground with 22 students who fall somewhere along the autism spectrum. The American Academy of Pediatrics describes the autism spectrum as \"a group of brain-based disorders that affect a child's behavior, social and communication skills.\" The students at the Marcus Center are grouped not by age, but by their level of function.

The job can be physically and emotionally demanding with a high burnout rate, according to Dr. Catherine Trapani, director of the education program at the Marcus Autism Center.

It helps that Waldrop loves children, but the right teacher for this job also has to be \"reflective, outgoing, serious and silly,\" Trapani said. \"When you have to do the same thing 5,000 times and you're still not getting the response that you're looking for, if you can't see the humor in that or if you can't have a lighthearted moment, then you're going to be a very unhappy person,\" she said.

      "article": "A virus that starts off like the common cold could be responsible for leaving more than 100 children with paralysis. Last summer, more than 1,000 children and teens across the country were hospitalized with symptoms that appeared to be caused by a particularly nasty strain of enterovirus. While some of the children showed only minor symptoms of the virus - such as runny nose, sneezing and coughing - others suffered weakness of the limbs to complete paralysis . Doctors caring for the sick children connected the illness early on to a pathogen called enterovirus D-68. A new study published on Monday has strengthened the connection between enterovirus D68 and the sudden paralysis of more than 100 children in the last year . A new study published Monday in the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases backed those initial opinions, after following the progress of 25 children in California and Colorado who experienced paralysis. Enteroviruses are a type of virus that use a single strand of RNA to replicate themselves inside the cells of mammals. Among other enteroviruses are polio, the virus that causes Hand Foot and Mouth disease along with others that cause a range of respiratory illnesses. Enterovirus D-68 is among the most recently idenfitied and was first spotted in California in 1962. It can cause mild to severe respiratory illness and is likely to be spread by inhaling virus particles when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or touches a surface. In previous years only small numbers of EV-D68 infections have been reported but that has increased during 2014, according to the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. It has caused severe illness in a number of children and has even been implicated in some deaths. The incidence of infections has fallen off considerably since October but public health officials warn that infections seem to spike during the late summer and autumn. Researchers now suggest that the children were infected with a mutated form of D-68, which first appeared four years ago. B1 has five to six coding differences that make it different from other strains commonly found in the U.S., and that these differences cause nerve-damaging symptoms similar to polio. And like polio, the nerve damage appears to be permanent - since none of the children have fully recovered. 'This is starting to look more like polio unfortunately where the paralysis appears to be permanent or semi-permanent. This is why there is such an urgency for more research to investigate this' researcher Charles Chiu, an associate professor at the University of California, San Francisco, said according to the Washington Post. However, the study has not definitely proved the connection between B1 and the paralyzed children, since researchers could not find the strain in the patients' spinal fluid. The researchers however, theorized that that was because the samples were taken too late. 'This is a virus that causes the common cold,' Chiu told NBC News. 'Parents don't bring their kids in until they are really sick. By that time, typically, the viral levels may be very, very low or undetectable.' They looked for other viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites that also could have caused the symptoms but none were present. Researchers were also not able to answer another mystery of the enterovirus - why some children only came down with minor symptoms and others lasting paralysis. Included in the study were two siblings that both came down with an 100 per cent genetically-identical strain of the virus in the past year. One of the siblings experienced paralysis while the other only suffered upper respiratory symptoms. With enterovirus season just a few months away in late summer, researchers are saying it's extremely important that more work be done to unravel the B1 mystery and make grounds to develop a vaccine to fight the dangerous virus.

Researchers have been studying the growing cases to identify similarities with other infectious diseases, signaling grave potential dangers to the general public health.

      "article": "Petrol prices should be slashed by 7p a litre by Christmas to keep pace with plummeting oil prices, the RAC says today. The 'overdue cut' would bring pump prices down to 114p a litre and deliver some added festive cheer, it said. The RAC's own monitoring of fuel prices shows there is 'scope for the price of a litre of petrol to come down by more than 7p a litre'. The motoring company is urging retailers to lower fuel prices in the run up to Christmas (file image) Diesel should drop by nearly 6p, it added: 'This would bring the average price of a litre of petrol to 114p and diesel to 120p – prices last seen across the country in March 2010. ' The RAC said: 'We are urgently calling on fuel retailers to pass on further savings in the wholesale price brought about by the continued fall in world oil prices. 'This overdue cut would reduce the biggest cost of motoring just in time for Christmas. Currently, the average price of petrol stands at 120.84p, with diesel at 125.43p. At the start of the year petrol was 130.79p a litre and diesel was 138.24p. The motoring organisation said that in June this year a barrel of crude reached a 2014 high of $115.36 – and the highest price since September last year . But since then it has fallen dramatically and as of Thursday stood at $68.59 – a fall of $46.77 or nearly 60 per cent. The RAC said: 'While the falling oil price has been reflected at the pumps by retailers consistently reducing forecourt prices, the latest savings in the wholesale price need to be passed on quickly to demonstrate transparency. ' RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: 'The tumbling oil price, coupled with a pound that is still strong against the dollar, have led to a phenomenon that many motorists are pretty unfamiliar with – falling pump prices.' Tesco and Asda are among retailers lowering prices. Above, the costs of fuel in 2005 . He said the forecast 7p a litre reduction that retailers should be passing on 'is the biggest the RAC has seen in recent years.' Petrol began to come down from its record high of 142.48p a litre on 17 April 2012. Diesel hit its record high of 147.93p on 13 April 2012). Supermarkets such as Asda and Tesco have been driving with price cuts, prompting retailers nearby to follow suit. Mr Williams said: 'Retailers now have a very reasonable record on transparent pricing so we have no reason to believe that they will not pass on the savings in the wholesale price. 'We just urge them to do it sooner rather than later to make the point very clearly to motorists that they operate a fair pricing system. 'If they do, we could well see petrol pump prices fall by well over 7p a litre in the next few weeks and diesel by almost 6p a litre. 'With this kind of drop in the national average prices, motorists will no doubt see some very low petrol prices – perhaps under 110p a litre from retailers who pride themselves on having the lowest prices.' The RAC said that with petrol at 114p a litre motorists would be saving over £9 filling up an average 55-litre family car compared to the beginning of the year, with the cost falling from £71.93 down to £62.70. Diesel at 120p a litre would save drivers £10 per fill-up – down from £76.03 to £66. Mr Williams said: 'This will be very welcome news just in time for Christmas when household budgets are really stretched. It should also be another boost for business as it will lower operating costs substantially. ' But he warned: 'While motorists are enjoying much lower forecourt prices it's important to recognise that they will always be limited by fuel duty, which represents nearly 58p in every litre, and VAT which is charged on top, at around 20p a litre.' He said a driver filling up a 55-litre petrol car at 114p a litre would pay £62.70 of which £31.87p would be duty, £10.45 VAT and only £20.38 for the fuel itself. In the Autumn Statement Chancellor George Osborne also said he was freezing fuel duty 'to help hardworking people be more financially secure.' Motorway filling stations – accused by motoring groups and ministers of 'ripping off' drivers with sky high prices - will soon have to post their charges in advance on roadside poles so motorists can decide whether to drive on by for a cheaper deal elsewhere, the Government announced this week taking a leaf from the France where this is law. Transport Minister Robert Goodwill said: 'For too long drivers have been ripped off by petrol prices on motorways.' Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander warned recently : 'When the price of oil falls, the public have a right to expect pump prices to fall like a stone, not a feather.' He was acting on long-standing complaints of motoring groups that pump prices rise 'like a rocket' when oil costs go up, but fall 'like a feather' when they come down.",

      "article": "There is growing concern that the United States could become gripped by a measles epidemic, according to the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said his agency is 'very concerned' about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in the U.S. His fears come as a growing number of people who have not been vaccinated against the disease are being exposed to the rest of the population. Scroll down for video . Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC said his agency is 'very concerned' about the possibility of a large measles outbreak in the U.S. Frieden said in an interview on CBS' 'Face the Nation' Sunday: 'What we've seen is, as over the last few years, a small but growing number of people have not been vaccinated. 'That number is building up among young adults in society, and that makes us vulnerable. 'We have to make sure that measles doesn't get a foothold in the U.S. It's been actually eliminated from this country for 15 years. 'All of our cases result, ultimately, from individuals who have traveled and brought it back here.' At last count, there were 102 reported cases of measles in 14 states across the country. However, this looks set to grow. The CDC has now launched an aggressive campaign to combat the spread of the disease which can be highly contagious. The organization aims to identify and isolate people who may have the disease in order to stop it spreading further. Frieden advised that the best way to halt the spread of the disease is by getting vaccinated and said that the vaccine is both safe and effective. At least 92 percent of the population is vaccinated. However, the number of children who are not vaccinated, is higher in some states, particularly in California where the most recent outbreak of the disease was linked to Disney theme parks. Yet, this outbreak, according to NBC probably came from overseas, carried either by a foreign tourist or by an American coming back with the virus. To date, the virus from Disneyland has infected 94 people in eight states, and 67 can be clearly linked to the theme park, health officials report. 'We don't know exactly how this outbreak started but we do think it was likely a person infected with measles overseas,' Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Vaccination: A child gets a vaccinated, but in southern California, eight percent of kindergarteners fail to get the required immunizations against measles, mumps and rubella . Outbreak: The outbreak of measles that started in California's Disneyland has infected 94 people in eight states, and 67 can be clearly linked to Disneyland, California health officials report . 'We assume that someone got infected with measles overseas, visited Disneyland park, and spread the disease to others.' According to CBS News, in southern California, eight percent of kindergarteners fail to get the required immunizations against measles, mumps and rubella. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, it's 15 percent of kindergarteners, because many parents simply do not want to 'risk' getting their child vaccinated. Frieden told the TV show that some parents who opt out of vaccinations cited a 'personal belief,' but it never appeared to be for a particularly strong reason. He also warned that parents are putting their child at risk if they do not vaccinate them, and this also puts others at risk too. The CDC is keen to avoid a devastating outbreak similar to the one which took hold in 1989 and 1991, when 55,000 people got measles and 123 died. Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but a few imported cases come in every year. But the CDC director does not want to see widespread mandatory vaccinations rolled out, like in Mississippi and West Virginia, which have nearly 100 percent vaccination rates.",

'We have to make sure that measles doesn't get a foothold in the U.S. It's been actually eliminated from this country for 15 years. 'All of our cases result, ultimately, from individuals who have traveled and brought it back here.' At last count, there were 102 reported cases of measles in 14 states across the country. However, this looks set to grow. The CDC has now launched an aggressive campaign to combat the spread of the disease which can be highly contagious. The organization aims to identify and isolate people who may have the disease in order to stop it spreading further. Frieden advised that the best way to halt the spread of the disease is by getting vaccinated and said that the vaccine is both safe and effective. At least 92 percent of the population is vaccinated. However, the number of children who are not vaccinated, is higher in some states, particularly in California where the most recent outbreak of the disease was linked to Disney theme parks. Yet, this outbreak, according to NBC probably came from overseas, carried either by a foreign tourist or by an American coming back with the virus. To date, the virus from Disneyland has infected 94 people in eight states, and 67 can be clearly linked to the theme park, health officials report. 'We don't know exactly how this outbreak started but we do think it was likely a person infected with measles overseas,' Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. Vaccination: A child gets a vaccinated, but in southern California, eight percent of kindergarteners fail to get the required immunizations against measles, mumps and rubella . Outbreak: The outbreak of measles that started in California's Disneyland has infected 94 people in eight states, and 67 can be clearly linked to Disneyland, California health officials report . 'We assume that someone got infected with measles overseas, visited Disneyland park, and spread the disease to others.' According to CBS News, in southern California, eight percent of kindergarteners fail to get the required immunizations against measles, mumps and rubella. Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, it's 15 percent of kindergarteners, because many parents simply do not want to 'risk' getting their child vaccinated. Frieden told the TV show that some parents who opt out of vaccinations cited a 'personal belief,' but it never appeared to be for a particularly strong reason. He also warned that parents are putting their child at risk if they do not vaccinate them, and this also puts others at risk too. The CDC is keen to avoid a devastating outbreak similar to the one which took hold in 1989 and 1991, when 55,000 people got measles and 123 died. Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, but a few imported cases come in every year. But the CDC director does not want to see widespread mandatory vaccinations rolled out, like in Mississippi and West Virginia, which have nearly 100 percent vaccination rates.\nSummary:\n",

Horrific: A care worker and her husband hid years of abuse by 'brainwashing' their children into thinking their punishments were 'horseplay' (file picture) A care-home worker and her husband who subjected their children to years of horrific abuse were facing jail yesterday after being convicted of cruelty. The couple hid their crimes for years by lying to social services and ‚öÑ≤brainwashing' their daughter and two sons into believing their sadistic punishments were ‚öÑ≤horseplay', a court heard. Details of their shocking attacks included: . ‚ö±‚ Pressing red-hot spoons against their children's skin and holding knives to their necks; . ‚ö±‚ Beating them with belt buckles and metal coat-hangers; . ‚ö±‚ Making their daughter sleep in a tent for three weeks in freezing conditions after wetting her bed; and . ‚ö±‚ Stabbing her with a dirty needle and telling her she would die of Aids. Following a week-long trial the parents, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were convicted of four counts of child cruelty, having previously admitted five similar offences. They will be sentenced next year, and could face a maximum prison sentence of ten years. Judge Pamela Badley said: ‚öÑ≤This is a very distressing case, and one where your heart went out to the children whose bitterness while giving evidence was quite palpable.

However, despite complaints to social services and the children's school by a family friend ‚öÑ≤every week', the youngsters remained in their parents' care in Chorley, Lancashire, until the eldest approached the police. The friend told the jury that her concerns were dismissed as ‚öÑ≤malicious'. ‚öÑ≤The children begged me to ring social services but my complaints were dismissed,' she said. ‚öÑ≤I've lost count of the amount of times I rang.'

Three samples of the drug-resistant bacteria taken from a hospital and neo-natal unit in Scotland closely matched a specific strain found in livestock .

MRSA, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, is a serious hazard in hospitals and nursing homes. The CC398 strain is known to cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections in both humans and animals. In dairy herds, it has been linked to cases of bovine mastitis. Dr Ward's team unravelled the full genetic codes of British CC398 samples and compared them with published genetic data on the same bugs from humans and livestock around the world. The research showed that the strain had entered the UK on several occasions since the mid-1940s, but the original source of the bacteria remained unclear. The most significant evidence of animal-to-human transmission came from three genetic sequences of MRSA collected in Scotland. The most significant evidence of animal-to-human transmission came from three genetic sequences of MRSA collected in Scotland. Two were from samples taken six months apart from a neonatal ward in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. File picture . Two were from samples taken six months apart from a neonatal ward in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. The third was obtained from a cleaning project at a Glasgow hospital. All three were a genetic match for MRSA CC398 strains in livestock. Writing in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology, the scientists concluded: 'It is possible that this finding represents the persistence of the livestock-associated strain of CC398 in hospital settings in the United Kingdom, with onward transmission between humans.

The CC398 strain is known to cause serious and sometimes life-threatening infections in both humans and animals. In dairy herds, it has been linked to cases of bovine mastitis. Dr Ward's team unravelled the full genetic codes of British CC398 samples and compared them with published genetic data on the same bugs from humans and livestock around the world. The research showed that the strain had entered the UK on several occasions since the mid-1940s, but the original source of the bacteria remained unclear. The most significant evidence of animal-to-human transmission came from three genetic sequences of MRSA collected in Scotland. The most significant evidence of animal-to-human transmission came from three genetic sequences of MRSA collected in Scotland. Two were from samples taken six months apart from a neonatal ward in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. File picture . Two were from samples taken six months apart from a neonatal ward in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. The third was obtained from a cleaning project at a Glasgow hospital. All three were a genetic match for MRSA CC398 strains in livestock. Writing in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology, the scientists concluded: 'It is possible that this finding represents the persistence of the livestock-associated strain of CC398 in hospital settings in the United Kingdom, with onward transmission between humans. 'Such a scenario should be investigated with more intensive sampling.'\nSummary:\n",

A distraught father who caused a four-hour standoff with police in a Texas hospital allegedly pointed his gun at a nurse and yelled 'I'll kill all of y'all'. Police said George Pickering, 57, made the threats from a hospital room after becoming inconsolable over the treatment of his son - a patient in critical care at Tomball Regional Hospital, near Houston. Armed police and a SWAT team descended on the medical center - and eventually convinced Pickering to surrender after a four-hour standoff on Saturday night. Pickering was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and is being held on a $30,000 bond, a statement from the Tomball Police department said. Detectives said Pickering was in the room with his son and family, waited for a nurse to come, then aimed his 9mm pistol at her. He then allegedly barricaded the room and threatened to kill anybody who came in. At the start of the confrontation, another of Pickering's sons, who was with him in the hospital room, allegedly wrested the gun away from him and handed it to police. Standoff: George Pickering, 57, allegedly threatened to kill a nurse with his pistol at Tomball Regional Hospital, sparking a police standoff . Response: Police and a SWAT team arrived at the hospital. Pickering reportedly had one gun taken from him, but said he had a second . Pickering then allegedly said, 'You don't think that's the only weapon I have?', prompting fears of a second gun and causing the lengthy showdown with police. But when he gave himself up, police found that he was not in fact armed. Early reports stated that Pickering had taken two hostages, but law enforcement later said there were no captives. A spokesman for the Tomball police department said Picerking fell ill during the standoff and was treated in the hospital overnight - and was still there Sunday afternoon.

Armed police and a SWAT team descended on the medical center - and eventually convinced Pickering to surrender after a four-hour standoff on Saturday night. Pickering was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and is being held on a $30,000 bond, a statement from the Tomball Police department said. Detectives said Pickering was in the room with his son and family, waited for a nurse to come, then aimed his 9mm pistol at her. He then allegedly barricaded the room and threatened to kill anybody who came in. At the start of the confrontation, another of Pickering's sons, who was with him in the hospital room, allegedly wrested the gun away from him and handed it to police. Standoff: George Pickering, 57, allegedly threatened to kill a nurse with his pistol at Tomball Regional Hospital, sparking a police standoff . Response: Police and a SWAT team arrived at the hospital. Pickering reportedly had one gun taken from him, but said he had a second . Pickering then allegedly said, 'You don't think that's the only weapon I have?', prompting fears of a second gun and causing the lengthy showdown with police. But when he gave himself up, police found that he was not in fact armed. Early reports stated that Pickering had taken two hostages, but law enforcement later said there were no captives. A spokesman for the Tomball police department said Picerking fell ill during the standoff and was treated in the hospital overnight - and was still there Sunday afternoon. He does not yet have an attorney. Tense: Pickering was said to be distraught over the condition of his son - a critical care patient .\nSummary:\n",

      "article": "(CNN) -- About to play Manchester United in the Champions League as the competition moves to its knockout phase, Real Madrid landed the first punch on their English rivals after the Spanish team became the first club in any sport to pass the ‚öá®500 million ($650.5 million) revenue mark in a single year, according to the annual Football Money League table. United was left lagging in third place with revenues of $502.4 million, just under $111 million behind Real's arch rivals Barcelona ($613 million), as La Liga secured a one-two finish in a financial report produced by accountants Deloitte that does not take into account a club's debt in its calculations. The Spanish giants' dominance in the football finance stakes comes despite the perilous state of Spain's economy, in recession since 2009 with unemployment currently hovering at around 25%, according to the country's labor ministry. Real, which has spent heavily in recent years in acquiring some of the world's leading players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Mesut Ozil and Angel Di Maria, won the domestic title last season and is chasing a record 10th title in the Champions League. It is not often that United -- who lead the English Premier League by five points -- finish in third, though a raft of recent financial deals could give next season's Football League table a very different complexion. \"Manchester United continue to successfully leverage their global brand,\" Austin Houlihan, Senior Manager in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said in a statement. \"The new world-record seven-year shirt sponsorship deal with General Motors will double the revenues the club receives from its shirt partner in the first season of the new deal in 2014/15. \"This combined with new Premier League broadcast deals from 2013/14, which will deliver incremental distributions of between £20 million ($31.7 million) and £30 million ($47.5 million) per club, will help Manchester United push the two Spanish clubs above them, for a top two ranking,\" added Houlihan. \"Indeed the new Premier League deals could mean that half of the Money League top 20 are represented by English clubs in a few years' time.\" For the fifth year in a row the clubs the Money League's top six clubs remained the same, with Bayern Munich in fourth, followed by Chelsea, with Arsenal in sixth. Revenue among the top 20 grew 10% on the previous year to reach $6.37 billion. \"It is an impressive achievement for Real Madrid to have surpassed ‚öá®500 million in revenue in a single year,\" said Dan Jones, Partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte. \"Real has led the way in the phenomenal rate of revenue growth achieved by the game's top clubs, with the double digit (10%) increase by the top 20 clubs representing continued strong performance in these tough economic times. \"The combined revenues of the top 20 clubs have quadrupled since we began our analysis in 1996/97. \"While eight of the top 20 clubs experienced a drop in revenue in 2011/12, in most cases this was due to less successful on-pitch performances in European club competitions, rather than wider recessionary impacts.\" English champions Manchester City is the joint highest climber after moving up to seventh in the table, while FIFA World Club champions Corinthians of Brazil are the highest placed non-European club with revenues of $123.7 million. The club's Premier League title win and its participation in the Champions League saw a 51% revenue growth to $452.6 million, the largest absolute and relative growth of any Money League club. \"The club's progress to the top of the English and European game means that they are set to remain a top 10 Money League club for the foreseeable future, and will look to push on ahead of the two English clubs immediately above them in the Money League, Arsenal and Chelsea, for a top five ranking,\" said Houlihan. There is also good news for German club Borussia Dortmund, up to 11th from 16th, while Italy's Napoli climbed five places to 15th following its Champions League exploits last season. There is only one new entry into the top 20 which is Newcastle United, which replaces Spanish club Valencia. The English Premier League has seven representatives in the top 20 rankings, five of which come in the top ten. Fair play? Football clubs seek to beat financial offside trap . The likes of Everton, Aston Villa, Fulham and Sunderland are hovering just outside, but there is no doubt as to which club continues to dominate revenue within the EPL. Deloitte's Football Money League list is based on a club's revenue from match-day revenue, television broadcasting rights and commercial revenue. The need for clubs to maximize these three areas will become ever important with the introduction of financial fair play regulations by European governing body UEFA. The report does not take into account the amount of debt which has been accumulated by each club. According to an article published on the Real Madrid website on September 13 2012, \"Net debt fell by 26.5% totaling ‚öá®124.7 million ($166 million), i.e. ‚öá®45 million less than in the previous period.\" Meanwhile, a report on the Barcelona's official website from June 2012 stated that the club had outstanding debts of ‚öá®320 million ($426 million). Manchester United's gross debt fell to £359.7 million ($569.6 million) in the three months to 30 September 2012, down 17% on a year earlier, according to widespread media reports. Facing the prospect of being punished with heavy fines and barred from European competition, they are desperate to make sure that generated revenues are equal or greater than expenditure.",

Real, which has spent heavily in recent years in acquiring some of the world's leading players such as Cristiano Ronaldo, Mesut Ozil and Angel Di Maria, won the domestic title last season and is chasing a record 10th title in the Champions League. It is not often that United -- who lead the English Premier League by five points -- finish in third, though a raft of recent financial deals could give next season's Football League table a very different complexion. \"Manchester United continue to successfully leverage their global brand,\" Austin Houlihan, Senior Manager in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte, said in a statement. \"The new world-record seven-year shirt sponsorship deal with General Motors will double the revenues the club receives from its shirt partner in the first season of the new deal in 2014/15. \"This combined with new Premier League broadcast deals from 2013/14, which will deliver incremental distributions of between £20 million ($31.7 million) and £30 million ($47.5 million) per club, will help Manchester United push the two Spanish clubs above them, for a top two ranking,\" added Houlihan. \"Indeed the new Premier League deals could mean that half of the Money League top 20 are represented by English clubs in a few years' time.\" For the fifth year in a row the clubs the Money League's top six clubs remained the same, with Bayern Munich in fourth, followed by Chelsea, with Arsenal in sixth. Revenue among the top 20 grew 10% on the previous year to reach $6.37 billion. \"It is an impressive achievement for Real Madrid to have surpassed ‚öá®500 million in revenue in a single year,\" said Dan Jones, Partner in the Sports Business Group at Deloitte. \"Real has led the way in the phenomenal rate of revenue growth achieved by the game's top clubs, with the double digit (10%) increase by the top 20 clubs representing continued strong performance in these tough economic times. \"The combined revenues of the top 20 clubs have quadrupled since we began our analysis in 1996/97. \"While eight of the top 20 clubs experienced a drop in revenue in 2011/12, in most cases this was due to less successful on-pitch performances in European club competitions, rather than wider recessionary impacts.\" English champions Manchester City is the joint highest climber after moving up to seventh in the table, while FIFA World Club champions Corinthians of Brazil are the highest placed non-European club with revenues of $123.7 million. The club's Premier League title win and its participation in the Champions League saw a 51% revenue growth to $452.6 million, the largest absolute and relative growth of any Money League club. \"The club's progress to the top of the English and European game means that they are set to remain a top 10 Money League club for the foreseeable future, and will look to push on ahead of the two English clubs immediately above them in the Money League, Arsenal and Chelsea, for a top five ranking,\" said Houlihan. There is also good news for German club Borussia Dortmund, up to 11th from 16th, while Italy's Napoli climbed five places to 15th following its Champions League exploits last season. There is only one new entry into the top 20 which is Newcastle United, which replaces Spanish club Valencia. The English Premier League has seven representatives in the top 20 rankings, five of which come in the top ten. Fair play? Football clubs seek to beat financial offside trap . The likes of Everton, Aston Villa, Fulham and Sunderland are hovering just outside, but there is no doubt as to which club continues to dominate revenue within the EPL. Deloitte's Football Money League list is based on a club's revenue from match-day revenue, television broadcasting rights and commercial revenue. The need for clubs to maximize these three areas will become ever important with the introduction of financial fair play regulations by European governing body UEFA. The report does not take into account the amount of debt which has been accumulated by each club. According to an article published on the Real Madrid website on September 13 2012, \"Net debt fell by 26.5% totaling ‚öá®124.7 million ($166 million), i.e. ‚öá®45 million less than in the previous period.\" Meanwhile, a report on the Barcelona's official website from June 2012 stated that the club had outstanding debts of ‚öá®320 million ($426 million). Manchester United's gross debt fell to £359.7 million ($569.6 million) in the three months to 30 September 2012, down 17% on a year earlier, according to widespread media reports. Facing the prospect of being punished with heavy fines and barred from European competition, they are desperate to make sure that generated revenues are equal or greater than expenditure.\nSummary:\n",

      "article": "London (CNN) -- The German Bundesliga has set the standard on the football pitch in recent months, now the league's bank accounts are the envy of Europe after a report declared the competition to be the continent's most profitable. The English Premier League continues to lead the way in terms of revenue, raking in $3.8 billion for the 2011-12 season, according to sports business group Deloitte. But the German league bests its rivals with combined profits of $242 million, compared to $154 million for the Premier League. The profit of clubs in the Bundesliga remained the same despite a drop in overall revenue to $2.36 billion for 2011-12 season, compared to $2.56 billion a year earlier. The Bundesliga's booming balance sheets reflect the division's recent on-field dominance. Runners-up in 2012, Bayern Munich were crowned kings of Europe in May after beating Borussia Dortmund in the first all-German Champions League final. \"The reason the Bundesliga is more profitable than the Premier League really comes down to the regulations that German football authorities have in place,\" Paul Rawnsley, a director at Deloitte, told CNN. \"They have a much stronger central control over the ownership and financial models of clubs.\" Rawnsley says there are two main aspects to rulings which enable German clubs to maximize their profits. \"Firstly, the regulations constrain the club's costs, and hence wage costs, as the clubs are limited in terms of how much they can spend in terms of wages-to-revenue ratio. \"Secondly, the regulations on club ownerships and the restrictions on external owners mean German clubs do not have the levels of extra contributions that we have seen in England. \"Over the last 5-6 years in England, there has been an extra $3 billion of money injected into clubs, which can be used to fund a higher level of wage costs.\" So without the influence of incredibly wealthy figures such as Sheikh Mansour (Manchester City) and Roman Abramovich (Chelsea), Bundesliga clubs spend 51% of their total revenue on wages. This is significantly lower than the 70% figure splashed out by English sides. The Premier League's continued growth is also tempered by debt. The combined debt of the 20 teams in England's top flight is $3.8 billion, a figure that is identical to the league's total revenue. However, Rawnsley believes the servicing of clubs' debts is not the issue it once was. \"A few years ago, debt was much more of a story but this year it has nudged downwards again,\" he explained. \"Debt levels are going down and the costs of servicing the debt are going down as well. \"In round numbers, the cost to Premier League clubs servicing their debts is $125 million.\" The reason for the relatively meager figure on debts of $3.8 billion is because $2.2 billion of that total has been provided by the financial backers of various clubs in the form of non-interest bearing \"soft loans.\" With new financial regulations from UEFA coming into play next season as well as an increased television deal that brings an extra $925 million to the Premier League, English clubs have the opportunity to increase profits next season.

      "article": "Australia has cemented its position as one of the world's fattest nations, a new study has revealed. The lucky country may not be so lucky coming in as the 25th largest nation in the Global Burden of Disease Study for 2013, which monitored the weight gain of 188 nations over a 33-year period. Along with New Zealand, Australia has experienced an 80 per cent increase in obesity rates in the past three decades, and it jumped nearly 40 places on the list, the biggest mover - but evidently not in the right way. The fat country: According to a new study obesity rates in Australia have increased exponentially over the last 33 years . Australia sits ahead of many European nations such as France and Germany, but still trailed the U.S. despite figures that show nearly one in three Aussies are considered obese. The study revealed that not one single nation decreased its overweight and obesity rates during the time period, a concerning statistic that could put pressure on health systems worldwide. Professor of Public Health at the University of Melbourne Rob Moodie told the Sydney Morning Herald that Australia had to act now if it wants to combat this obesity crisis. 'Waiting for a cure is not possible...The public health system will be crushed by the obesity crisis and the rise in cancer, heart disease and diabetes.' 'We have also failed to get anywhere with front of pack labeling, or with food reformulation, because of a huge resistance from the industry to anything that might improve our health,' Professor Moodie also told the publication. Put the pressure on: These increased rates will put strain on the public health system . These findings put the strain on the government to cut back on junk food marketing, restore the healthy food-star rating system and push companies to cut sugar and fat contents in their products. The study, which tracked the weight gain of adults and children from 1980 to 2013, was based on Body Mass Index measurements (BMI) which work on the relationship between height and weight to produce a figure. Anyone with a BMI of 25 or more is considered overweight, while a rating of 30 or more deems an individual as being obese. Nearly 30 per cent, or 5.2 million Australian adults, are classified as being obese - compared with a much lower figure of 16 per cent in 1980. The Global Burden of Disease findings also said that more than half of the world's obese people now live in developing countries, and around a quarter of children are suffering from obesity. In the lead: Around 5.2 million Australian adults are now considered obese . Another concern in Australia is that cuts in the recent budget could have an impact on fighting this obesity trend thanks to funding being scaled back on programs that target prevention in schools and communities. Professor of Health Policy at Curtin University, Mike Daube, told the publication that obesity has crept up on Australia as a nation and new co-payment scheme may defer people from seeing their GP about the issue. Obesity is linked to major health problems such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and range of cancers.",

Along with New Zealand, Australia has experienced an 80 per cent increase in obesity rates in the past three decades, and it jumped nearly 40 places on the list, the biggest mover - but evidently not in the right way. The fat country: According to a new study obesity rates in Australia have increased exponentially over the last 33 years . Australia sits ahead of many European nations such as France and Germany, but still trailed the U.S. despite figures that show nearly one in three Aussies are considered obese. The study revealed that not one single nation decreased its overweight and obesity rates during the time period, a concerning statistic that could put pressure on health systems worldwide. Professor of Public Health at the University of Melbourne Rob Moodie told the Sydney Morning Herald that Australia had to act now if it wants to combat this obesity crisis. 'Waiting for a cure is not possible...The public health system will be crushed by the obesity crisis and the rise in cancer, heart disease and diabetes.' 'We have also failed to get anywhere with front of pack labeling, or with food reformulation, because of a huge resistance from the industry to anything that might improve our health,' Professor Moodie also told the publication. Put the pressure on: These increased rates will put strain on the public health system . These findings put the strain on the government to cut back on junk food marketing, restore the healthy food-star rating system and push companies to cut sugar and fat contents in their products. The study, which tracked the weight gain of adults and children from 1980 to 2013, was based on Body Mass Index measurements (BMI) which work on the relationship between height and weight to produce a figure. Anyone with a BMI of 25 or more is considered overweight, while a rating of 30 or more deems an individual as being obese. Nearly 30 per cent, or 5.2 million Australian adults, are classified as being obese - compared with a much lower figure of 16 per cent in 1980. The Global Burden of Disease findings also said that more than half of the world's obese people now live in developing countries, and around a quarter of children are suffering from obesity. In the lead: Around 5.2 million Australian adults are now considered obese . Another concern in Australia is that cuts in the recent budget could have an impact on fighting this obesity trend thanks to funding being scaled back on programs that target prevention in schools and communities. Professor of Health Policy at Curtin University, Mike Daube, told the publication that obesity has crept up on Australia as a nation and new co-payment scheme may defer people from seeing their GP about the issue. Obesity is linked to major health problems such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure and range of cancers.\nSummary:\n",

      "article": "(CNN) -- Additional polio cases have been confirmed in two new areas in Syria: near the capital of Damascus and in northern Aleppo, near Turkey, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. In Syria's first outbreak of the disease since 1999, 10 cases of polio were initially confirmed among children last month. That number has now risen to 17, the WHO said. In addition to 15 cases confirmed in Deir Ezzor province, \"two additional cases have been confirmed, one each in rural Damascus and Aleppo, confirming widespread circulation of the virus,\" the WHO said in a statement. It said the risk of further spread of the disease was considered high given the fighting, large-scale movement of refugees and number of children who have not been fully immunized in the country. Last month, health officials launched a program to immunize 1.6 million Syrian children against polio, measles, mumps and rubella -- in government- and rebel-held areas. The response, which also includes neighboring countries, is expected to last at least six months, the WHO has said. \"A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases in addition to implementing the recommended supplementary immunization activities with oral polio vaccine,\" the WHO said. About 22 million children under the age of 5 are being targeted in mass polio vaccination campaigns in the region, it said. According to UNICEF, 500,000 children in Syria have not been vaccinated against polio. The highly infectious viral disease, which spreads via fecal-oral transmission and contaminated food and water, primarily affects young children. Initial symptoms can include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness, limb pain and, in a small number of cases, paralysis and death. It can be prevented through immunization, but there is no cure. The incidence of the disease has dropped by more than 99% since 1988. It remains endemic in three countries -- Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghanistan -- down from more than 125 countries in 1988. Public health can be among the first casualties of war, as resources are diverted from ensuring clean water supplies and intact sewer lines.

Watch Iraqi girls describe a long way from home  . The reason behind the jump in the number of Iraqis at the school is a new government policy: For the first time since the start of the Iraq war, Jordan is allowing all Iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools. Simply, this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked. The move is cementing a massive population shift in the Middle East. More than 2.2 million Iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland, most of them seeking refuge in neighboring Jordan and Syria, according to humanitarian officials. Jordanian Minister of Education Khalid Touqan says he expects Jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 Iraqi students this year. That's more than double the number of Iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago. Harb, on the front line of the phenomenon, says the influx is putting a strain on her school.

Iraqi families are changing the social fabric of Jordanian society. About 10 percent of Jordan's population is now made up of Iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them.

Alex and Coral Pouros had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot. They had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to dairy and soya, and planned to buy food for themselves from the zoo restaurant. Alex and Coral Pouros (pictured with their son) had spent £30 on the day out to Wingham Wildlife Park with 20 month-old Elliot . But they were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead. The family refused and left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and vowed never to return. Osteopath Alex, 32, said: 'We explained the situation and as it was very cold outside I thought he would be understanding. 'I even said that if they had any dairy or soya-free food, we would buy that for Elliott. 'They didn't, but he still insisted he could not eat his lunch in the restaurant. The couple had prepared a special meal for the youngster who is restricted on what he can eat because of an intolerance to lactose and soya . The couple had planned to buy their own lunch at Wingham Wildlife Park's restaurant (pictured) 'To be honest, we were pretty upset because it seemed totally unreasonable. It's not as if the place was packed because there were plenty of places to sit. 'I wasn't prepared for Elliott to have to eat his lunch outside in the cold and told the owner that we had two choices - either we were allowed to sit indoors or we would have to leave. 'But he wouldn't budge so we left after spending £30 to get in and having a visit that lasted just a couple of hours.' Alex, of Broadstairs, Kent, added: 'It was actually Coral's 32nd birthday and we thought it would be a nice day out, but sadly it wasn't. 'We had been to the park before with a young niece and enjoyed the experience but this time we just felt angry and hurt and certainly won't be going back.' Markus Wilder, curator of the animal collection, disputed the family's claim there was no options for their son at the cafe. 'We have a menu of 55 items and there are only ten of them that contain soya or dairy,' he said. 'Any of our cooked meals he would have been fine to eat; we have jacket potatoes, burgers...' But the family were furious when park owner Tony Binskin insisted they could not eat in the restaurant and offered them a nearby empty room instead . The family left the zoo near Canterbury, Kent after just two hours and have since vowed never to return . Mr Wilder said the family had been asked to leave the restaurant due to the park's strict policy but claimed they had been offered their own private room instead. 'We're only a fairly small park, and we have fairly limited seating so we have a policy that you cannot eat outside food from outside in the restaurant. It applies across the board. 'The trouble is if we let one person have a packed lunch, then others see it and start to ask why they have been refused. 'It just gets very awkward for us because many people and children have special dietary requirements these days. 'In this case, I spoke to the family and did offer them an empty room nearby where they could still eat indoors, but the mother, in particular, still wasn't happy. 'We also have covered areas outside for people who bring their own food.

      "article": "Parents will now have to pay up to $90 for their child to fly alone on a Qantas flight. The increase in young kids flying without a parent has risen, prompting the Australian airline to charge a fee. Children aged five to 11 who are travelling domestically without an adult will cost parents $50 in travelling fees, while international flights will see parents paying $90 for their children to travel alone. Kids travelling alone for longer than six hours have to be at least six-years-old. Parents will now have to pay up to $90 for their child to fly unaccompanied on a Qantas flight . The Qantas fees will commence November 3 but will not exist for unaccompanied children aged 12 to 15 . The fees will commence November 3 but will not exist for unaccompanied children aged 12 to 15, Traveller reports. The new charges for children travelling without an adult will double if payment is not made before arriving at the airport - $100 for domestic and $180 for international. If your child is travelling to multiple destinations unaccompanied make sure each flight has been made on one booking, as travel agents are told the fee is only for each booking, not for each flight. 'Qantas recognises the importance of providing children travelling alone with the highest levels of comfort and support,' a spokeswoman said. 'Given the increasing demand for this extra support, and the increasing costs involved, we cannot continue to provide this service completely free of charge. This change brings Qantas in line with many of its domestic and international competitors.' Children aged five to 11 who are travelling domestically without an adult will cost parents $50 in travelling fees, while international flights will see parents paying $90 for their children to travel alone . Children who are travelling alone on a Qantas flight are offered 'additional administration at airports, immigration and security processing for international flights, onboard assistance and a ground staff escort at the airport', writes the Traveller. Lay-over rooms are also provided at some airports for young people waiting to board a flight.

      "article": "By . Sean Poulter . PUBLISHED: . 19:55 EST, 13 January 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 19:55 EST, 13 January 2014 . Families threw away mountains of good food over Christmas amid complaints supermarkets continue to encourage people to buy too much. One in five people threw away or wasted more than 10 per cent of the food they bought over Christmas and New Year, according to a new study. Tonnes of fresh vegetables and salad, mince pies and turkey were piled into bins after they went off before they could be eaten. A new study has found that one in five people wasted more than 10 per cent of the food they bought over the festive period . Families blamed supermarket promotions for over-indulging on food purchases they could not eat. Some 70 per cent said supermarkets urged them to increase their food purchasing over the festive season – with 45 per cent saying they did buy more. Seventy-two per cent of shoppers said they were tempted by Buy-One-Get-One-Free Offers(BOGOFS), while 70 per cent said they bought extra because of half-price deals. More than a third named discounts such as vouchers, money off single items and loyalty card offers as other routes to increased and often unnecessary buying. The study was commissioned by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and comes one year after it published a major study - Global Food; Waste Not, Want Not – estimating that between 30 to 50per cent of all food produced is never eaten. Dr Tim Fox, Head of Energy and Environment at the Institution, said: ‚öÑ≤This latest survey shows that UK shoppers still feel they are encouraged to buy too much food, despite significant progress on raising awareness of food waste in 2013, and some retailer action to reduce over-purchasing. Seventy-two per cent of respondents said they were tempted by Buy One Get One Free deals, while 70 per cent said they had bought extra because of the deals . ‚öÑ≤There are various reasons why around a third to a half of all food produced in the world never reaches a human stomach, and while it would be wrong to lay all of the blame for waste with the supermarkets - deals like Buy-One-Get-One-Free, ‚öÑ∫half price‚öÑπ offers and various other price discounting methods do exacerbate the problem.' He said: ‚öÑ≤It is certainly a concern that over a fifth of the people surveyed said they had thrown away more than 10per cent of the food they bought over the festive period. ‚öÑ≤This food could be used to help feed those in hunger today, and is also an unnecessary waste of the considerable land, water and energy resources that were used in the production, processing and distribution of this food - resources that could be used to meet other human needs. ‚öÑ≤If we are to have a sustainable future on a planet with over nine billion people on board it is important that everybody, from the Government and retailers through to consumers at home, tries to reduce the amount of food that is wasted and thinks about the land, water and energy resources involved in bringing food to the plate.' The survey of 2,023 people found that the older generation threw less food away. Some 45per cent of over 65s said they did not waste or throw away any of the food, which compares to just a third of those aged 18-24. The Institution said the world produces about four billion metric tonnes of food per year, but between a third and a half of this is wasted through poor practices and inadequate infrastructure. The study, Global Good; Waste Not Want Not estimated that between 30 and 50 per cent of all food produced is never eaten. File picture . The group said it would be possible to feed the world's growing population without the need to increase production greatly, if more of the food that is produced was eaten rather than wasted. Supermarkets have attempted to shift the blame for food waste from themselves to customers. A senior executive at Tesco caused controversy in December by suggesting that fussy customers, who were unwilling to buy misshapen or blemished fresh produce, were to blame. Matt Simister, food sourcing director at Tesco, told a House of Lords inquiry, that customers will also select the freshest and best looking fruit and vegetables. He said: ‚öÑ≤Customers naturally select, they always pick the cream of crop first and the rest of it then gets left. ‚öÑ≤Then the new deliveries come in and you have the new cream of the crop – the old, ugly misshapen produce goes to waste. ‚öÑ≤Customers will always make the choice of the one that cosmetically looks better.

Families threw away mountains of good food over Christmas amid complaints supermarkets continue to encourage people to buy too much. One in five people threw away or wasted more than 10 per cent of the food they bought over Christmas and New Year, according to a new study. Tonnes of fresh vegetables and salad, mince pies and turkey were piled into bins after they went off before they could be eaten. A new study has found that one in five people wasted more than 10 per cent of the food they bought over the festive period . Families blamed supermarket promotions for over-indulging on food purchases they could not eat. Some 70 per cent said supermarkets urged them to increase their food purchasing over the festive season – with 45 per cent saying they did buy more. Seventy-two per cent of shoppers said they were tempted by Buy-One-Get-One-Free Offers(BOGOFS), while 70 per cent said they bought extra because of half-price deals. More than a third named discounts such as vouchers, money off single items and loyalty card offers as other routes to increased and often unnecessary buying. The study was commissioned by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and comes one year after it published a major study - Global Food; Waste Not, Want Not – estimating that between 30 to 50per cent of all food produced is never eaten. Dr Tim Fox, Head of Energy and Environment at the Institution, said: ‚öÑ≤This latest survey shows that UK shoppers still feel they are encouraged to buy too much food, despite significant progress on raising awareness of food waste in 2013, and some retailer action to reduce over-purchasing. Seventy-two per cent of respondents said they were tempted by Buy One Get One Free deals, while 70 per cent said they had bought extra because of the deals . ‚öÑ≤There are various reasons why around a third to a half of all food produced in the world never reaches a human stomach, and while it would be wrong to lay all of the blame for waste with the supermarkets - deals like Buy-One-Get-One-Free, ‚öÑ∫half price‚öÑπ offers and various other price discounting methods do exacerbate the problem.' He said: ‚öÑ≤It is certainly a concern that over a fifth of the people surveyed said they had thrown away more than 10per cent of the food they bought over the festive period. ‚öÑ≤This food could be used to help feed those in hunger today, and is also an unnecessary waste of the considerable land, water and energy resources that were used in the production, processing and distribution of this food - resources that could be used to meet other human needs. ‚öÑ≤If we are to have a sustainable future on a planet with over nine billion people on board it is important that everybody, from the Government and retailers through to consumers at home, tries to reduce the amount of food that is wasted and thinks about the land, water and energy resources involved in bringing food to the plate.' The survey of 2,023 people found that the older generation threw less food away. Some 45per cent of over 65s said they did not waste or throw away any of the food, which compares to just a third of those aged 18-24. The Institution said the world produces about four billion metric tonnes of food per year, but between a third and a half of this is wasted through poor practices and inadequate infrastructure. The study, Global Good; Waste Not Want Not estimated that between 30 and 50 per cent of all food produced is never eaten. File picture . The group said it would be possible to feed the world's growing population without the need to increase production greatly, if more of the food that is produced was eaten rather than wasted. Supermarkets have attempted to shift the blame for food waste from themselves to customers. A senior executive at Tesco caused controversy in December by suggesting that fussy customers, who were unwilling to buy misshapen or blemished fresh produce, were to blame. Matt Simister, food sourcing director at Tesco, told a House of Lords inquiry, that customers will also select the freshest and best looking fruit and vegetables. He said: ‚öÑ≤Customers naturally select, they always pick the cream of crop first and the rest of it then gets left. ‚öÑ≤Then the new deliveries come in and you have the new cream of the crop – the old, ugly misshapen produce goes to waste. ‚öÑ≤Customers will always make the choice of the one that cosmetically looks better. That's a very difficult reality to us.' In October, Tesco revealed that it generated almost 30,000 tons of food waste in the first six months of the year. It found that up to two thirds of supermarket food ends up in the bin, including 68 per cent of bagged salads, half of bakery goods and a quarter of grapes.

      "article": "(CNN) -- Two suspected rebel leaders accused of having committed war crimes in Sudan's Darfur region surrendered to the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, the court announced. Abdallah Banda Abakaer Nourain and Saleh Mohammed Jerbo Jamus are charged with three counts of war crimes stemming from an attack on African Union peacekeepers in September 2007, the ICC said. They arrived voluntarily at the court at The Hague on Wednesday following summonses issued last August, the court said. Their first appearance before the chamber was scheduled for Thursday morning. Both men are now staying at a undisclosed location, where they will remain for the course of the proceedings, the ICC said. The men each led armed groups that carried out the attack on the African Union peacekeepers, the court said. Banda led splinter forces of the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), and Jerbo commanded troops from a breakaway faction of the Sudanese Liberation Army/Movement, it said. In the attack, about 1,000 men armed with anti-aircraft guns, artillery and rocket-propelled grenade launchers killed 12 African Union peacekeeping troops and severely wounded eight others in Haskanita, in northern Darfur, the court said. They also destroyed peacekeepers' communications installations, dormitories and vehicles and stole computers, cell phones, uniforms, ammunition and money, the court said. It was the deadliest single attack on the peacekeepers since they began their mission in late 2004. The voluntary surrender of the two accused was \"the culmination of months of efforts,\" ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo said. \"The appearance of the two suspects means that all the persons we wish to prosecute in connection with the Haskanita attack have now appeared before the court,\" he said. The case against Jerbo and Banda is the fourth one dealing with Darfur that has been handled by the court. In one case, Ali Kushayb, a militia leader, and Ahmad Harun, former minister of state for the interior in Sudan, are still at large. Both face charges of murder, rape, forced displacement and other offenses during the Darfur crisis, which the United States characterizes as a genocide. The prosecutor offered them the option of voluntary surrender, Moreno-Ocampo said. \"They refused to cooperate, and the judges issued arrest warrants against them,\" he said. Sudan has refused to extradite them, and has been found in \"non-compliance\" with U.N. Security Council resolutions as a result, he said. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir -- who was just reelected last month -- is wanted by the court for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Darfur. He also remains at large. A third case involved Bahar Idriss Abu Garda, of Sudan's Zaghawa tribe. He appeared voluntarily before the court last year on charges of murder, directing attacks on peacekeepers, and pillaging in the 2007 attack on the peacekeepers, but the court declined to pursue those charges in February citing insufficient evidence. The attack on the AU peacekeepers came months before the 7,000-strong force was replaced by a United Nations peacekeeping force of 26,000 troops. The U.N. force, known as UNAMID, is a joint operation between the United Nations and the African Union and took over formally at the end of 2007. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have been forced from their homes. Sudan denies that the death toll is that high. The violence in Darfur erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Sudanese authorities armed and cooperated with Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations.

      "article": "A Pennsylvania teacher who had sex with two students an flashed her breasts at another teen has been jailed for up to 23 months. Lauren Harrington-Cooper enticed the students into sexual affairs by telling them: 'All the candy you need is right here.' The married 32-year-old pleaded guilty to having sexual intercourse with an 18-year-old student in her car and also performing oral sex. She also had sex with a 17 year old she had met while teaching in the Wyoming Valley West School district in Pennsylvania. Harrington-Cooper, an English teacher, pleaded guilty to two counts of sexual contact with students and two counts of corrupting minors. Pennsylvania high school teacher Lauren Harrington-Cooper was sentenced to 9 to 23 months in jail, accused of having sex with two students . Harrington-Cooper, 32, is walked to her jail cell after her sentencing for sex crimes in Pennsylvania on Thursday . Prosecutors said she showed her breasts to a 17 year old and had sexual contact with another. Harrington-Cooper was sentenced to nine to 23 months in jail, according to the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader newspaper. Assistant District Attorney Jenny Roberts said the four victims had moved on with their lives.

The father of a Cherokee girl at the center of a custody battle is to be extradited to South Carolina to face accusations that he interfered with a court order to give her adopted parents visitation rights. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed the extradition papers yesterday, ordering Dusten Brown to South Carolina for 'disobeying a court order'. Mr Brown has been granted an emergency stay to keep three-year-old Veronica, but he is accused of denying visitation rights to Matt and Melanie Capobianco, her adopted parents. Family history: Dusten Brown and daughter Veronica met for the first time on New Year's Eve 2011 . He surrendered to the Sequoyah County Court earlier today and was released on bond, according to Wistv 10. The Capobiancos, who have cared for the little girl from birth, have been locked in a custody battle for years with Mr Brown, the child's biological father. Veronica's birth mother put her up for adoption but Mr Brown, a member of the Cherokee Nation, fought the Capobiancos' adoption of her under the Indian Child . Welfare Act. Order: Governor Mary Fallin has signed extradition papers for Dusten Brown . In a statement yesterday, Governor Fallin said: 'Unfortunately, it has become clear that Dusten Brown is not acting in good faith', Fox News reported. 'He has disobeyed an Oklahoma court order to allow the Capobiancos to visit their adopted daughter, and continues to deny visitation.' The couple had their adoption approved by the courts on July 31, but last month Mr Brown refused to hand Veronica over, which led to an extradition order being requested. He faces charges of custodial interference in South Carolina. Governor Fallin had said last month she would not sign the extradition order if Mr Brown showed a willingness to work with his daughter's adopted parents. But, in her statement, she said: 'He is acting in open violation of both Oklahoma and South Carolina courts ... he has cut off negotiations with the Capobiancos and shown no interest in pursuing any other course than yet another lengthy legal battle.' An attorney for Mr Brown however, said the extradition order doesn't mean he will be extradited. Mr Brown will have a judicial hearing to argue South Carolina doesn't allege a crime, just a violation, according to News 9. Clark Brewster added that the Capobiancos had visited Veronica a lot, and said his legal team has offered to meet Ms Fallin to explain the situation but so far she has declined their invitation. Last week, Oklahoma Supreme Court granted an emergency stay to keep Veronica with her biological father. Access: The Oklahoma Supreme Court has granted an emergency stay to keep three-year-old Cherokee girl Veronica with her biological father . Court order: Dusten Brown leaves a custody hearing at Oklahoma Supreme Court on Wednesday . Denied: Melanie and Matt Capobianco have not been allowed access to their adopted daughter, according to the extradition order signed by Governor Fallin . Both sides were in a Nowata County . court last Friday. The Oklahoma Supreme Court granted an emergency stay to . the Nowata court's ruling that Veronica should be transferred . immediately to the Capobiancos. The stay comes after Mr Brown turned himself in to authorities on August 12, but refused extradition to South Carolina, where the Capobiancos live, and where state authorities had finalized Veronica's adoption. 'This is my daughter,' Mr Brown said, according to Anderson Cooper 360. 'It isn't a yoyo I borrowed for two years.' Mr Brown posted $10,000 bond and was released on August 12, according to Oklahoma's Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office. Battle: Veronica with her biological father, Dusten Brown, who wants to raise her . Adopted parents: Matt and Melanie Capobianco were awarded custody of the girl they raised from birth . Last week, a lawyer appointed to look out for the best interests of the three-year-old asked a judge to suspend visitation rights for her adoptive parents - a complete turnaround after the South Carolina court awarded the Capobiancos custody of Veronica on July 31. The James Island, South Carolina parents have been trying to adopt Veronica since her birth in 2009 after which they raised the girl for two years. But Mr Brown has had custody of his daughter since 2011, when South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled that a 1978 federal law written to ensure Native American children stay with Native American parents gave him preference over the Capobiancos. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law does not apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of Veronica and abandoned her before birth. Mr Brown had never met his daughter . and, after Veronica's mother, who is not an American American, rebuffed . his marriage proposal, played no role during the pregnancy and paid no . child support after the girl was born. The . legal proceedings began when Mr Brown found out Veronica was going to . be adopted. He objected and said the Indian Child Welfare Act favored . the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions. In the middle: Veronica has been caught in an ongoing tug of war custody battle for most of her young life . The Capobiancos appealed the South Carolina Supreme Court's 2011 decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and it ruled in June that South Carolina courts should decide who gets to adopt Veronica. The state court said the Capobiancos should raise the girl. South Carolina Family Court Judge Daniel Martin finalized the couple's adoption, approving a transition plan detailing a gradual process for reintroducing the girl to the Capobiancos. South Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Mr Brown's arrest, charging him with custodial interference for failing to appear with the girl for a court-ordered meeting with the Capobiancos on August 4 ‚öÑÆ a date the couple has said was set by the judge and to which Brown's attorneys did not object.",

Clark Brewster added that the Capobiancos had visited Veronica a lot, and said his legal team has offered to meet Ms Fallin to explain the situation but so far she has declined their invitation. Last week, Oklahoma Supreme Court granted an emergency stay to keep Veronica with her biological father. Access: The Oklahoma Supreme Court has granted an emergency stay to keep three-year-old Cherokee girl Veronica with her biological father . Court order: Dusten Brown leaves a custody hearing at Oklahoma Supreme Court on Wednesday . Denied: Melanie and Matt Capobianco have not been allowed access to their adopted daughter, according to the extradition order signed by Governor Fallin . Both sides were in a Nowata County . court last Friday. The Oklahoma Supreme Court granted an emergency stay to . the Nowata court's ruling that Veronica should be transferred . immediately to the Capobiancos. The stay comes after Mr Brown turned himself in to authorities on August 12, but refused extradition to South Carolina, where the Capobiancos live, and where state authorities had finalized Veronica's adoption. 'This is my daughter,' Mr Brown said, according to Anderson Cooper 360. 'It isn't a yoyo I borrowed for two years.' Mr Brown posted $10,000 bond and was released on August 12, according to Oklahoma's Sequoyah County Sheriff's Office. Battle: Veronica with her biological father, Dusten Brown, who wants to raise her . Adopted parents: Matt and Melanie Capobianco were awarded custody of the girl they raised from birth . Last week, a lawyer appointed to look out for the best interests of the three-year-old asked a judge to suspend visitation rights for her adoptive parents - a complete turnaround after the South Carolina court awarded the Capobiancos custody of Veronica on July 31. The James Island, South Carolina parents have been trying to adopt Veronica since her birth in 2009 after which they raised the girl for two years. But Mr Brown has had custody of his daughter since 2011, when South Carolina's Supreme Court ruled that a 1978 federal law written to ensure Native American children stay with Native American parents gave him preference over the Capobiancos. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the law does not apply in this case because the biological father never had custody of Veronica and abandoned her before birth. Mr Brown had never met his daughter . and, after Veronica's mother, who is not an American American, rebuffed . his marriage proposal, played no role during the pregnancy and paid no . child support after the girl was born. The . legal proceedings began when Mr Brown found out Veronica was going to . be adopted. He objected and said the Indian Child Welfare Act favored . the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions. In the middle: Veronica has been caught in an ongoing tug of war custody battle for most of her young life . The Capobiancos appealed the South Carolina Supreme Court's 2011 decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, and it ruled in June that South Carolina courts should decide who gets to adopt Veronica. The state court said the Capobiancos should raise the girl. South Carolina Family Court Judge Daniel Martin finalized the couple's adoption, approving a transition plan detailing a gradual process for reintroducing the girl to the Capobiancos. South Carolina authorities issued a warrant for Mr Brown's arrest, charging him with custodial interference for failing to appear with the girl for a court-ordered meeting with the Capobiancos on August 4 ‚öÑÆ a date the couple has said was set by the judge and to which Brown's attorneys did not object.\nSummary:\n",

      "article": "(CNN) -- In the wake of an online video in which soldiers returning from Afghanistan complained that Delta Air Lines charged their unit more than $2,800 in bag-check fees, two rival carriers on Thursday said they will loosen their checked-bag restrictions for active-duty military members. American Airlines announced it will allow military personnel to check an extra two bags with no out-of-pocket expense, and AirTran Airways said later Thursday it will waive baggage charges for \"members of the military who are traveling on active duty orders.\" The airline's policy is identical to that of Southwest Airlines, which acquired AirTran in a merger last September, AirTran spokesman Christopher White told CNN. American Airlines airline will have policy fully implemented \"in the next few days,\" spokeswoman Dori Robau Alvarez said in a statement released Thursday. The airlines were the latest of the major U.S. carriers to change their policies. Delta and Continental/United announced Wednesday they were loosening their checked-bag policies for military personnel. Previously, American Airlines allowed three bags to be checked free, \"with full government reimbursement to military personnel on any bags above that number,\" but the carrier decided to increase the free-bag limit to five, \"given the potential confusion with different military units carrying different amounts of bags depending on their mission,\" according to the statement. The statement continued: \"Both our revised 5-bag policy as well as the previous policy allowed active military personnel traveling either on orders or on personal travel to utilize our military bag policy. In addition, American also allows military personnel traveling on orders to have one of their free bags weigh up to 100 pounds and (to be) 126 linear inches in size without penalty. ... This greatly helps with the typical, large military duffel bags.\" Its limits on other bags are 50 pounds and 62 linear inches, it said. AirTran's fee waiver also comes with some size and weight restrictions: \"As long as each piece of baggage does not exceed 100 pounds in weight and 80 inches in size (length plus width plus height), you will be exempt from baggage charges, and will not be subject to excess, oversized, or overweight baggage charges,\" White said in an e-mail to CNN . The Delta incident got instant notoriety after servicemen spoke out about their experience in a video posted on YouTube. In the clip, which the men say was recorded on board a Delta flight from Baltimore to Atlanta on Tuesday, a day after they returned from Afghanistan, the soldiers explain they had \"a little issue with the bags.\" CNN affiliate WXIA in Atlanta identified the soldiers as U.S. Army Staff Sgts. Fred Hilliker and Robert O'Hair. The men, who were bound for Fort Polk, Louisiana, said their military travel orders allowed them to carry up to four bags, but when they arrived at the airport in Baltimore, Delta told them it allowed military personnel to check only three bags for free. Members of the unit who were traveling with four bags ended up paying out of pocket for their extra luggage, the soldiers said in the video. They were charged $200 per extra bag, so the 34-member unit ended up paying more than $2,800 in bag fees, the soldiers said. Any extra bag fees charged by an airline will be reimbursed by the government, a military spokeswoman told CNN affiliate WGCL in Atlanta. One of the soldiers in the video said the bag he had to pay for was a weapons case that contained \"the tools that I used to protect myself and Afghan citizens while I was deployed in the country.\" The other man then looked into the camera, exasperated. \"Good business model, Delta,\" he said sarcastically. \"Not happy. Not happy at all,\" he added, shaking his head. On Wednesday, Delta changed its policy: Effective immediately, U.S. military personnel traveling on orders are now allowed to check up to four bags for free in coach and five bags in first class and business class. Delta spokeswoman Susan Elliot on Thursday said the airline will reimburse the complaining soldiers for any fourth-bag fees that the military will not cover, and is giving them travel vouchers good for future trips. United/Continental also announced Wednesday it will allow more bags. \"United and Continental are waiving the fourth checked bag fee for military personnel traveling on orders in recognition of their sacrifice and service to our country,\" Christen David, a spokeswoman for United/Continental Airlines, said in an e-mail. The two airlines closed a merger deal in October. Delta said it deeply respects and admires men and women in uniform and added that it has worked hard to ensure that U.S. military personnel get \"additional flexibility\" when they travel on the carrier. The carrier said it's \"continuing to work with the soldiers individually to make this situation right for each of them.\" The soldiers may have been misinformed about how many bags traveling active duty military personnel can check for free, according to Stars and Stripes, the independent news organization focusing on the military.

Prince Harry spent yesterday signing forms to ensure he receives a £200-a-week bonus for flying combat missions against the Taliban in Afghanistan. The tax-free gratuity – awarded to all troops in the war zone – will be added to the £38,931 captain's salary the Prince receives for piloting an Apache helicopter gunship. But there is little chance that Harry will be able to spend the extra cash on Christmas presents – the bonus is paid at the end of a tour of duty, and the Prince is not expected to return home until January. Britain's Prince Harry inspects the weaponry he will be using to shoot Taliban insurgents with from the powerful Apache helicopter . Back in action: Prince Harry is shown the inside of an Apache by a member of his squadron at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan . Concentration: Harry will be operating as a co-pilot gunner while part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, Army Air Corps . The so-called Operational Allowance is paid at a rate of £29.02 for every day served in the war zone. Harry, . 27 – known as Captain Wales to his colleagues – arrived in Afghanistan . on Thursday night as part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, . Army Air Corps. Another . Apache pilot said: ‚öÑ≤Each time we serve in Afghanistan, it is for four . months – and no holidays in Britain, or Las Vegas, while we're there. We . get a lot of stick from the soldiers on the ground because their tours . last six months rather than four, but our jobs are more mentally . demanding. Harry has the backing of everyone in the Army Air Corps. He . performed very well in training and was too good in the Apache to be . ordered to ‚öÑ∫fly a desk'' – what we call office duties. Prince Harry expressing his enthusiasm at being back in Afghanistan to serve as a military helicopter pilot four years after his previous deployment there had to be cut short . Harry examines the 30mm cannon of an Apache helicopter with the 16 Air Assault Brigade . ‚öÑ≤He'll fly his first operational sorties with a pilot from the outgoing squadron, probably at the end of this week. 662 Squadron are taking over from 664 Squadron who have been in Helmand province since May.' Harry is said to be popular with his colleagues – who were quick to test his sense of humour. He was mocked after winning an award for his skills on a course in Arizona. The pilot added: ‚öÑ≤Before his training out there, nobody had heard of an award for best gunner. So the joke ran that it was made up by the Americans just for him.' Last night, Harry was completing his RSOI . (Reception, Staging, Onward-Movement and Integration) training at Camp . Bastion – the main British base in Helmand Province. Demonstrations . included what to do if he finds a suspect package and if Bastion comes . under rocket attack. Fun times: Prince Harry along with friends and females partied in an exclusive, heavily guarded, VIP Bungalow at Wet Republic in Las Vegas . Anyone who sees a suspicious object is responsible for establishing a cordon and alerting the camp guards. Concerns that explosives will be smuggled into Bastion have triggered a security upgrade. More than 100 troops are on permanent guard, with military police and dogs on standby. To enhance Harry's security, he will also be shadowed by close protection officers. They will eat in the same canteen and share the Prince's accommodation. To guard against a terrorist attack by a Taliban undercover agent, Afghan troops are not allowed near him. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said that a threat assessment had been undertaken prior to Harry's deployment – to ensure his presence in Helmand would not put him or his colleagues at greater risk.",

Prince Harry spent yesterday signing forms to ensure he receives a £200-a-week bonus for flying combat missions against the Taliban in Afghanistan. The tax-free gratuity – awarded to all troops in the war zone – will be added to the £38,931 captain's salary the Prince receives for piloting an Apache helicopter gunship. But there is little chance that Harry will be able to spend the extra cash on Christmas presents – the bonus is paid at the end of a tour of duty, and the Prince is not expected to return home until January. Britain's Prince Harry inspects the weaponry he will be using to shoot Taliban insurgents with from the powerful Apache helicopter . Back in action: Prince Harry is shown the inside of an Apache by a member of his squadron at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan . Concentration: Harry will be operating as a co-pilot gunner while part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, Army Air Corps . The so-called Operational Allowance is paid at a rate of £29.02 for every day served in the war zone. Harry, . 27 – known as Captain Wales to his colleagues – arrived in Afghanistan . on Thursday night as part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, . Army Air Corps. Another . Apache pilot said: ‚öÑ≤Each time we serve in Afghanistan, it is for four . months – and no holidays in Britain, or Las Vegas, while we're there. We . get a lot of stick from the soldiers on the ground because their tours . last six months rather than four, but our jobs are more mentally . demanding. Harry has the backing of everyone in the Army Air Corps. He . performed very well in training and was too good in the Apache to be . ordered to ‚öÑ∫fly a desk'' – what we call office duties. Prince Harry expressing his enthusiasm at being back in Afghanistan to serve as a military helicopter pilot four years after his previous deployment there had to be cut short . Harry examines the 30mm cannon of an Apache helicopter with the 16 Air Assault Brigade . ‚öÑ≤He'll fly his first operational sorties with a pilot from the outgoing squadron, probably at the end of this week. 662 Squadron are taking over from 664 Squadron who have been in Helmand province since May.' Harry is said to be popular with his colleagues – who were quick to test his sense of humour. He was mocked after winning an award for his skills on a course in Arizona. The pilot added: ‚öÑ≤Before his training out there, nobody had heard of an award for best gunner. So the joke ran that it was made up by the Americans just for him.' Last night, Harry was completing his RSOI . (Reception, Staging, Onward-Movement and Integration) training at Camp . Bastion – the main British base in Helmand Province. Demonstrations . included what to do if he finds a suspect package and if Bastion comes . under rocket attack. Fun times: Prince Harry along with friends and females partied in an exclusive, heavily guarded, VIP Bungalow at Wet Republic in Las Vegas . Anyone who sees a suspicious object is responsible for establishing a cordon and alerting the camp guards. Concerns that explosives will be smuggled into Bastion have triggered a security upgrade. More than 100 troops are on permanent guard, with military police and dogs on standby. To enhance Harry's security, he will also be shadowed by close protection officers. They will eat in the same canteen and share the Prince's accommodation. To guard against a terrorist attack by a Taliban undercover agent, Afghan troops are not allowed near him. A Ministry of Defence spokesman said that a threat assessment had been undertaken prior to Harry's deployment – to ensure his presence in Helmand would not put him or his colleagues at greater risk.\nSummary:\n",

The English Premier League champions also reported that its turnover for the year had increased by almost $73 million to $536 million, as it considers a plan to raise a further $1 billion on the Singapore Stock Exchange to reduce its considerable debt burden. United's net debt stands at $498.7 million, in part due to the money the U.S.-based Glazer family had to raise to buy the club for $1.2 billion in 2005. The deal effectively left the club with a huge mortgage and crippling interest payments -- believed to be around $72 million a year, according to British media reports. Blog: Football's financial folly . But a hugely successful year on and off the pitch has helped to alleviate the pressure. On the pitch, they won their 19th Premier League title -- another record -- and were beaten finalists in the lucrative Champions League, Europe's top club competition. The club also scored off the pitch with a series of high-profile commercial deals, including the first year of their $129 million shirt sponsorship agreement with the Aon Corporation and a $64 million deal with logistics company DHL to sponsor their training kit. United top Forbes' football rich list . However, the club's financial strategy is increasingly focused on Asia, where it has an estimated 190 million supporters -- helped in no small part by the proliferation of English Premier League broadcast rights across the region in recent years. As a result, United's owners favor Singapore for the initial public offering (IPO) to cash in on this enormous fan base, though Britain's Guardian newspaper reported that they will pursue a dual-share structure, whereby investors will have to purchase one \"non-voting\" share for every voting share.

Speaking to reporters at the White House, Obama opened up about his rationale for signing off on a government brief that was filed in an appeal of California's 2008 prohibition of same-sex marriage. The Justice Department brief submitted on Thursday urged the high court to invalidate the ban. \"Let's treat everybody fairly. Let's treat everybody equally,\" Obama said. The issue could be a defining moment in Obama's presidency, similar to the political impact last year when the high court upheld the health care reform law that he spearheaded. The president and the nation have evolved on same-sex marriage . It is rare for a president to become personally involved in the legal and political considerations in a Supreme Court appeal, and sources say Obama spent a good deal of time reading up on the issue and articulating his views privately before the brief was filed. The administration is not a party in the California appeal, one of two same-sex marriage cases before the high court this term, and was not required to offer an opinion although the Justice Department often does so in important constitutional cases. Sources said Obama made the final decision for the administration to submit a viewpoint and signed off on the wording.

The president further raised expectations of an expanded view in the sweeping rhetoric of his inaugural address in January. Much of the reasoning in any government brief would, in large part, reflect Obama's personal thinking, gained from his years as a former constitutional law professor. He offered a studied analysis of the issue. \"What we've said is that same-sex couples are a group, a class that deserves heightened scrutiny. The Supreme Court needs to ask the state why it's doing it, and if the state doesn't have a good reason, it should be struck down. That's the core principle, as applied to this case,\" Obama said Friday. \"Now, what the court may decide that if it doesn't apply in this case, it probably can't apply in any case,\" he continued. \"There's no good reason for it. If I were on the court, that would probably be the view that I would put forward. But I'm not a judge, I'm the president.\" The new Obama has his heart on his sleeve .

Fleury will walk free from jail next week after having his sentence halved . A driver who killed a father of two by driving on the wrong side of the road has been freed by Appeal Court judges because he is French. Alexis Sebastien Fleury had ‚öÑ≤lower culpability' for causing the death of 62-year-old David Crane than a British driver would have done, the judges ruled. Mr Crane, of Rolvenden, Kent, was on his way home from work at 11.30pm on August 3, 2012, when his Skoda Fabia was hit head-on by Fleury's grey Renault Laguna on the A28 near Tenterden. Charity fundraiser Mr Crane, who was a carer for his disabled wife, suffered multiple injuries and died at the scene. Fleury was acquitted by a jury at Canterbury Crown Court of causing death by dangerous driving but was convicted of causing death by careless driving in July and jailed for 18 months. Yesterday Lord Justice Lloyd Jones, Mr Justice Irwin and Mr Justice Green, sitting at London's Criminal Appeal Court, halved that sentence to nine months – meaning 25-year-old Fleury will walk free next week. The court heard that Fleury from Orleans, central France, was driving to visit his English girlfriend, Emily Crick, in Wadhurst, East Sussex. He had travelled from France through the Eurotunnel. Fleury performed a U-turn and was driving down the wrong side of the road, when he crashed head-on into Mr Crane's car. The Frenchman had been awake for 16 hours and had been driving for six and a-half hours at the time. But his lawyers argued that there was ‚öÑ≤no evidence' that he had been tired, because he napped on the shuttle through the tunnel. Fleury said during his trial: ‚öÑ≤I missed my turning and decided to do a U-turn. I was driving for a few seconds and saw headlights just in front of me and boom.' Mr Justice Irwin said: ‚öÑ≤This young man made a mistake at the end of his journey.

The Cabinet Minister is now spared from paying the average £112-a-year ‚öÑ≤green duty' added to most domestic bills after he moved his account to a firm that does not have to pay it. Last night, a senior Tory MP accused Lib Dem Mr Davey of ‚öÑ≤tax avoidance' by ‚öÑ≤finding a way' to escape the levies. Ed Davey is now spared from paying the average £112-a-year ‚öÑ≤green duty' added to most domestic bills after he moved his account to a firm that does not have to pay it . The Mail on Sunday has highlighted the rocketing cost of the UK's green commitments, which include cutting the power industry's CO2 emissions by 90 per cent by 2030 and tripling the proportion of power generated from wind, solar and ‚öÑ≤biomass' sources. Experts say the plan will cost in excess of £100 billion – all funded by a tariff on domestic and business consumers. Mr Davey recently changed from Sainsbury's Energy to Green Star Energy to supply gas and electricity to his Kingston constituency home. Green Star – which, despite its name, is not an eco-certified company – does not have to pay green taxes because it is a new firm with fewer than 250,000 customers. Its average household bill is just over £1,009 a year, compared with Sainsbury's average of £1,264 – meaning Mr Davey could potentially save about £255 annually. The average standard bill across all energy suppliers is around £1,346. Green sceptic Peter Lilley, a Tory member of the energy and climate change committee, said last night: ‚öÑ≤He is paying less than most people as he is not being hit with those levies, it is as simple as that. He has found a way to avoid this unfair burden on families which his own department is inflicting. It is a form of tax avoidance.' Smaller firms also do not have to pay for the Energy Company Obligation, which costs customers about £47 a year towards the cost of funding insulation for low-income households. Mr Davey has saved around £255 by switching from Sainsbury's to Green Star Energy .

However, if Mr Davey's decision encourages enough other customers to switch to Green Star and the firm passes the 250,000 threshold, it too will be liable for the green levies. Last week it was revealed more than 900 onshore and offshore wind turbines were built in the past year, with the annual bill for green subsidies topping £3billion. Of that, an estimated £765 million went to onshore wind farms; £935 million to offshore wind farms; £800 million to biomass plants; £500 million to solar plants and £100 million to hydroelectric power. Wind power produced nine per cent of the nation's electricity, up from six per cent in 2012. Energy firms complain that, as a result, some gas plants are left barely running, further pushing up electricity bills. The Energy Secretary made his account switch through Big Deal Energy.

But viewers seem to have turned on Broadchurch, criticising the new series' 'soap opera' plotlines and branding it a 'fancy EastEnders'. As character Joe Miller goes on trial for the murder of 11-year-old schoolboy Danny Latimer, many viewers have also been left frustrated by the 'unrealistic' court scenes. Scroll down for video . Viewers of the second show of series two of Broadchurch complained about legal inaccuracies as the trial of Joe Miller, whose previous admission for killing 11-year-old Danny Latimer, was ruled inadmissible . Millions of viewers have tuned in for the return of the ITV drama, starring David Tennant as Detective Inspector Alec Hardy and Olivia Coleman as his partner, DS Ellie Miller - also wife of murder suspect Joe Miller. During last night's show it was the initial crown court scenes that attracted criticism. Viewers complained about normal legal processes being subverted - with some commenting on potential witnesses sitting in court, listening to proceedings before they gave evidence. They also noted that despite his not guilty plea just a few weeks before, Miller's trial appears to have come round a lot quicker than is normal in the current British judicial system. In reality, it can take several months for cases to be heard. Marc Willers QC, a human rights barrister, tweeted: 'Broadchurch ruined for me by totally unrealistic court room scenes. 'Very annoying for lawyers watching such twaddle.' In last night's episode most of the key witnesses are shown sitting in court despite the fact only a couple have given evidence so far, including suspect Mark Latimer as he watches Beth in the witness stand. Wee Scottish Mummy added: 'Am I only one who thought Broadchurch was v unrealistic last night? A criminal trial starting w'in weeks, witnesses listening in court etc?' Judge Meera Syal last night ruled that the killer's confession – which Joe Miller had given willingly – was in fact inadmissible. Viewers complained about unrealistic scenes and proper court processes not being followed in Broadchurch . Other viewers commented on the unrealistic timescales with Joe Miller's trial starting weeks after his plea . Experts also complained about legal arguments being conducted in front of a jury - when this would normally take place behind closed doors in front of a judge to ensure members of the jury are not prejudiced. The first series of Broadchurch premiered in March 2013 and was nominated for seven BAFTA awards. It focused on the death of 11-year-old Danny Latimer and the impact of grief and media attention on the town. Most of the cast has returned for the second series. It was a bad night for DI Alec Hardy and DS Ellie Miller in Broadchurch last night as Miller's trial began . Around 7.2million people tuned in for the first installment of the second series but some complained that they were forced to use subtitles to understand what was happening, because David Tenant mumbled and actors spoke in strong Scottish accents.

Peter Nash, 41, was extradited from Australia to the US last week accused of conspiring to sell large quantities of drugs through the black-market internet drug supermarket Silk Road .

He was the primary moderator on the Silk Road site, sent Ulbricht a 'weekly report' of his work and was paid between $US50,000 and $US75,000 a year, according to prosecutors. As well as selling drugs and other illicit items, the Silk Road site provided the platform for the sale of computer hacking software, including 'password stealers, keyloggers and remote access tools'. Nash is charged with narcotics conspiracy, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison, if convicted. Nash was the primary moderator on the Silk Road site and was paid between $US50,000 and $US75,000 a year, according to prosecutors . He is also charged with one count of conspiracy to commit computer hacking and one count of money laundering conspiracy. They carry maximum sentences of five and 20 years' prison respectively. Silk Road allegedly operated via the 'deep web', an area of the internet off limits to standard search engines, and involved a Tor hidden service designed to allow users to browse and buy items anonymously. US authorities shut the site down in 2013 when Ulbricht was arrested and another, known as Silk Road 2.0, came online soon after, but was also closed by authorities.

New York's top federal prosecutor, Preet Bharara, announced a year ago the unsealing of the indictment against Brisbane-based Nash and the two other alleged site administrators, Virginia's Andrew Jones, 25, and Ireland's Gary Davis, 26. Silk Road's alleged San Francisco-based owner and operator, Ross Ulbricht, known by the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, was arrested on October 1 last year.

Soldiers at a U.S. base in Afghanistan on Thursday honor the victims of September 11, 2001. According to numbers CNN has compiled from military statements, 112 American troops have died in Afghanistan in 2008, compared with 111 in all of 2007. The death toll has sparked concern among the U.S. military and its allies. Adm. Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a congressional committee Wednesday that the U.S. is \"running out of time\" to win the war in Afghanistan. Mullen said the U.S. needs better nation-building initiatives and a stronger cross-border strategy with Pakistan to ensure victory over Islamic militants in the poor Asian country. \"We can't kill our way to victory, and no armed force anywhere, no matter how good, can deliver these keys alone. It requires teamwork and cooperation,\" Mullen told the House Armed Services Committee. In addition to those killed in Afghanistan, the military also includes troops who died outside the country if they were part of Operation Enduring Freedom, the war launched nearly seven years ago in and around Afghanistan.

      "article": "More people have been infected with measles in the United States during the first four months of this year than have been infected in the first four months of the past 18 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Data released Thursday reveal a dramatic rise in measles outbreaks. Health officials say 13 outbreaks and 129 cases have been recorded this year, according to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. California is reporting the highest numbers, with 58 cases from January 1 to April 14. That's the most cases of measles in the state since 1995. In the past 13 years, the average number of measles cases was nine per year. The CDC says many of the California cases are a result of people visiting the Philippines, which is experiencing a very large measles outbreak; at least 20,000 confirmed and suspected cases have been reported in the Asian nation. Visitors may pick up the disease and bring it back to the U.S., potentially infecting those who cannot be vaccinated against the measles because they are too young, for example, or who have intentionally remained unvaccinated. Another problem that may be contributing to the increase in cases is a lack of awareness among doctors. \"Because of the success of the measles vaccine, many clinicians have never seen measles and may not be able to recognize its features,\" Dr. Julia Sammons writes in a commentary published Thursday in Annals of Internal Medicine. Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases. Symptoms usually include fever, cough and conjunctivitis, along with a rash. In rare cases, measles can lead to pneumonia and brain infections, which can be fatal. The last time there was a reported death from measles in the U.S. was in 2005, says Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Schuchat credits the CDC's Vaccines for Children program with contributing to high immunization rates and the dramatic decrease of measles in the U.S. In the U.S., half of all children under 19 are eligible for the program, which provides vaccines to children whose parents or caregivers can't afford them. According to the CDC, vaccinations have proved to be very successful in the U.S., preventing an estimated 323 million illnesses and 732,000 deaths. Schuchat says it's impossible to predict what the coming months will bring, but she thinks more people could die from measles. \"Unfortunately, it's probably just a matter a time.\" The CDC recommends that children get two doses of the measles vaccine beginning at 12 months, with the second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years old. Infants 6 to 11 months old should get the vaccine before international travel. Schuchat says it's absolutely crucial for measles vaccinations to be up to date. To further reduce the spread of measles, the CDC also recommends that all U.S. residents born after 1956 ensure that they are still immune to measles or receive a new MMR vaccination, particularly if they expect to travel outside North or South America.",

      "article": "BOISE, Idaho (CNN) -- Firefighter Jonathan Frohreich had never heard of The Wildland Firefighter Foundation, much less its founder, until recovering from severe work-related injuries last month. Vicki Minor's Wildland Firefighter Foundation has granted more than $1.5 million in aid to more than 500 families. As he lay in his hospital bed in Sacramento, California, Vicki Minor put her hand on his shoulder. \"She introduced herself and told me that she was there to help,\" recalls Frohreich, who had been in a helicopter crash that killed nine of his colleagues. \"She just said, 'Anything.' She was there to do anything for me.\" Since 1999, Minor has dedicated herself to providing emergency assistance and ongoing support to injured and fallen wildfire fighters and their families nationwide through her Wildland Firefighter Foundation. Wildland firefighters are called into action when the United States' vast natural resources are threatened by fire. For Frohreich, Minor's foundation supplied lodging and food for family and friends who visited his bedside. It also provided emergency funds for medical and other expenses, arranged for Frohreich to meet with firefighters who carried him to safety, and brought his fallen comrades' family members to a bereavement ceremony. \"She means everything,\" Frohreich said. \"She's one of the best things to ever happen.\" Minor first became involved with the wildland firefighter community 21 years ago after witnessing a wildfire for the first time. \"I had never seen anything like it,\" Minor recalls of the blaze in the mountains of Idaho. \"All those firefighter units mobilized in camps that cropped up. It was like an invasion, and I was mesmerized.\" Minor started a fire camp commissary, providing dry goods, clothing and necessities to the firefighters. But it wasn't until tragedy struck in 1994 at Storm King Mountain, Colorado, where 14 firefighters perished in a single day, that Minor was overcome with a need to assist the families. The Storm King fire was a turning point. \"Fighting fire is much like fighting a war. There's no time to tend to the injured, or tend to the dead. The fire doesn't stop raging,\" Minor said. \"I looked up at the heavens and I said to those kids, 'Help me help your families.' \" Grieving wildland families, like those of fallen soldiers, tend to be young and scattered throughout the country, often enduring their sudden loss in isolation from their firefighting community. Taking cues from a visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., Minor spearheaded fundraising efforts for the erection of the Wildland Firefighters Monument in Boise, Idaho, which contains markers \"for almost every wildland firefighter that has fallen,\" Minor said. \"I had seen and felt the healing of those combat veterans that would touch a name of their friend,\" Minor said. \"Our wildland firefighters had nothing like that to process their grief. I wanted to create a place where our families could congregate, reach out in solidarity and comfort to honor their fallen and injured.\" Watch Minor describe the sculptures in the firefighter monument  . Since 1999, the foundation has continued to grow, assisting more than 500 wildland firefighters and their families with more than $1.5 million in emergency funds and services, including communication support; travel and lodging for the injured and fallen; and emotional and benefit counseling and advocacy.

Vicki Minor's Wildland Firefighter Foundation has granted more than $1.5 million in aid to more than 500 families. As he lay in his hospital bed in Sacramento, California, Vicki Minor put her hand on his shoulder. \"She introduced herself and told me that she was there to help,\" recalls Frohreich, who had been in a helicopter crash that killed nine of his colleagues. \"She just said, 'Anything.' She was there to do anything for me.\" Since 1999, Minor has dedicated herself to providing emergency assistance and ongoing support to injured and fallen wildfire fighters and their families nationwide through her Wildland Firefighter Foundation. Wildland firefighters are called into action when the United States' vast natural resources are threatened by fire. For Frohreich, Minor's foundation supplied lodging and food for family and friends who visited his bedside. It also provided emergency funds for medical and other expenses, arranged for Frohreich to meet with firefighters who carried him to safety, and brought his fallen comrades' family members to a bereavement ceremony. \"She means everything,\" Frohreich said. \"She's one of the best things to ever happen.\" Minor first became involved with the wildland firefighter community 21 years ago after witnessing a wildfire for the first time. \"I had never seen anything like it,\" Minor recalls of the blaze in the mountains of Idaho. \"All those firefighter units mobilized in camps that cropped up. It was like an invasion, and I was mesmerized.\" Minor started a fire camp commissary, providing dry goods, clothing and necessities to the firefighters. But it wasn't until tragedy struck in 1994 at Storm King Mountain, Colorado, where 14 firefighters perished in a single day, that Minor was overcome with a need to assist the families. The Storm King fire was a turning point. \"Fighting fire is much like fighting a war. There's no time to tend to the injured, or tend to the dead. The fire doesn't stop raging,\" Minor said. \"I looked up at the heavens and I said to those kids, 'Help me help your families.' \" Grieving wildland families, like those of fallen soldiers, tend to be young and scattered throughout the country, often enduring their sudden loss in isolation from their firefighting community. Taking cues from a visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., Minor spearheaded fundraising efforts for the erection of the Wildland Firefighters Monument in Boise, Idaho, which contains markers \"for almost every wildland firefighter that has fallen,\" Minor said. \"I had seen and felt the healing of those combat veterans that would touch a name of their friend,\" Minor said. \"Our wildland firefighters had nothing like that to process their grief. I wanted to create a place where our families could congregate, reach out in solidarity and comfort to honor their fallen and injured.\" Watch Minor describe the sculptures in the firefighter monument  . Since 1999, the foundation has continued to grow, assisting more than 500 wildland firefighters and their families with more than $1.5 million in emergency funds and services, including communication support; travel and lodging for the injured and fallen; and emotional and benefit counseling and advocacy.

      "article": "By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:00 AM on 10th November 2011 . A juror in the Michael Jackson trial has broken her silence to reveal why his private doctor was convicted of killing him. Debbie Franklin said she and her co-jurors found Dr Conrad Murray guilty for three reasons - he failed to call 911, had no medical backup equipment and left Jackson alone. The mother-of-two said the jurors were particularly struck by the evidence that the 'king of pop' was still alive when Dr Murray found him. Speaking out: Debbie Franklin, a juror in the Conrad Murray trial, said jurors found Michael Jackson guilty for three different reasons . She told Good Morning America that if he had the right equipment available the 51-year-old star might have lived. Asked if Jackson would still be alive, but for Dr Murray, she said: 'Yes. Absolutely.' She added: 'Conrad Murray did it. Conrad Murray agreed to be the one to . go into the bedroom and do this. He [Jackson] was looking for somebody . to say yes, and Conrad Murray said yes.' Despite this, Ms Franklin said the jury believed Dr Murray did not intentionally mean to kill Jackson. 'We don't think he even had a motive to do this. We think it was . something that he was doing that was careless that got out of hand.' Ms Franklin, who was juror number five in the trial, said initially the panel could not reach a verdict after the first day of deliberations. Guilty: Handcuffs are placed on Dr Conrad Murray as he is remanded into custody after the jury returned with a guilty verdict in his involuntary manslaughter trial over Michael Jackson's death . She said they were split and agreed to spend the weekend thinking about the evidence. On Monday after further deliberations Dr Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and now faces up to four years in jail. Ms Franklin, a mother of two, said: 'We really did our job. Our hearts were pounding. Pop legend: Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009. Dr Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and now faces up to four years in jail . 'On the first day it wasn't unanimous, We talked about it and said lets think about over the weekend. It was stressful, there was yelling.' Ms Franklin, who works as legal assistant, said of Jackson: 'I believe he had issues, he had addictions. He was looking for someone to say yes, and Dr Murray said yes.' Ms Franklin said Jackson was still alive when Dr Murray returned to his room having been absent to ring his girlfriends. 'When he came back Dr Murray said he was alive. He was not breathing, he had pulse,' she told the TV show. 'At that point he was alive. If he had the medical equipment there, if the airways were blocked, he had nothing.' Ms Franklin said after nine hours of talking the panel of 12 voted with a show of hands to find Murray guilty. Each of the jurors wrote their decision on a piece of paper and they returned to the Los Angeles courtroom to deliver the verdict. Ms Franklin added that she was not surprised to see the 55-year-old doctor led away in handcuffs as he had been found guilty. 'I never gave it a second thought,' she said. 'It didn't bother me.' She also praised the role of the prosecution team during the trial. 'I thought they did an excellent job. They were ready for every witness. The questioning went from beginning to end. Nothing seemed to sidetrack them.' Dr Murray could face four years in prison when he is sentenced on November 29. Ms Franklin said : 'I'm glad I don't have to make that decision. 'I really have no feeling one way or the other what the sentence is. We did our job.'",

A juror in the Michael Jackson trial has broken her silence to reveal why his private doctor was convicted of killing him. Debbie Franklin said she and her co-jurors found Dr Conrad Murray guilty for three reasons - he failed to call 911, had no medical backup equipment and left Jackson alone. The mother-of-two said the jurors were particularly struck by the evidence that the 'king of pop' was still alive when Dr Murray found him. Speaking out: Debbie Franklin, a juror in the Conrad Murray trial, said jurors found Michael Jackson guilty for three different reasons . She told Good Morning America that if he had the right equipment available the 51-year-old star might have lived. Asked if Jackson would still be alive, but for Dr Murray, she said: 'Yes. Absolutely.' She added: 'Conrad Murray did it. Conrad Murray agreed to be the one to . go into the bedroom and do this. He [Jackson] was looking for somebody . to say yes, and Conrad Murray said yes.' Despite this, Ms Franklin said the jury believed Dr Murray did not intentionally mean to kill Jackson. 'We don't think he even had a motive to do this. We think it was . something that he was doing that was careless that got out of hand.' Ms Franklin, who was juror number five in the trial, said initially the panel could not reach a verdict after the first day of deliberations. Guilty: Handcuffs are placed on Dr Conrad Murray as he is remanded into custody after the jury returned with a guilty verdict in his involuntary manslaughter trial over Michael Jackson's death . She said they were split and agreed to spend the weekend thinking about the evidence. On Monday after further deliberations Dr Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and now faces up to four years in jail. Ms Franklin, a mother of two, said: 'We really did our job. Our hearts were pounding. Pop legend: Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009. Dr Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and now faces up to four years in jail . 'On the first day it wasn't unanimous, We talked about it and said lets think about over the weekend. It was stressful, there was yelling.' Ms Franklin, who works as legal assistant, said of Jackson: 'I believe he had issues, he had addictions. He was looking for someone to say yes, and Dr Murray said yes.' Ms Franklin said Jackson was still alive when Dr Murray returned to his room having been absent to ring his girlfriends. 'When he came back Dr Murray said he was alive. He was not breathing, he had pulse,' she told the TV show. 'At that point he was alive. If he had the medical equipment there, if the airways were blocked, he had nothing.' Ms Franklin said after nine hours of talking the panel of 12 voted with a show of hands to find Murray guilty. Each of the jurors wrote their decision on a piece of paper and they returned to the Los Angeles courtroom to deliver the verdict. Ms Franklin added that she was not surprised to see the 55-year-old doctor led away in handcuffs as he had been found guilty. 'I never gave it a second thought,' she said. 'It didn't bother me.' She also praised the role of the prosecution team during the trial. 'I thought they did an excellent job. They were ready for every witness. The questioning went from beginning to end. Nothing seemed to sidetrack them.' Dr Murray could face four years in prison when he is sentenced on November 29. Ms Franklin said : 'I'm glad I don't have to make that decision. 'I really have no feeling one way or the other what the sentence is. We did our job.'\nSummary:\n",

But not today. Instead, students approached in silence, carrying photographs and flowers. In small groups, the teenagers lined up to lay tributes to their lost classmates before hugging each other wordlessly, or dissolving into tears. At 10:53 a.m. Tuesday morning, this school in the small western German town of Haltern was changed forever by events more than 1,000 km (about 620 miles) away. A Germanwings plane carrying 16 of its pupils and their two teachers home from a school exchange trip to Spain crashed in the French Alps, killing all of those on board. Headmaster Ulrich Wessel said when the first reports of a crash came through he was still hopeful, thinking \"perhaps they had missed the plane, or perhaps there was a second Germanwings flight at the same time.\" Instead, the worst was confirmed, leaving him \"stunned and somewhat speechless,\" the community devastated and the classmates of the dead struggling to understand their loss. \"A week ago Tuesday we sent 16 happy young people and two young colleagues off on a trip,\" Wessel told reporters. \"What was intended as a school exchange ended in tragedy.\" Of the 16 teenagers killed, 14 were girls, and two boys; one of the two female teachers who died was a newlywed. In a post on the school's website, Wessel and other school representatives announced the names of the dead, \"who will never again return to us,\" leaving all those concerned \"unutterably sad.\" The teenagers who died were: Linda Bergjurgen, Elena Bless, Lea Druppel, Selina Eils, Gina Michelle Gerdes, Ann-Christin Hahn, Julia Hermann, Marleen Koch, Paula Lutkenhaus, Fabio Rogge, Rabea Scheideler, Lea Schukart, Helena Siebe, Steffen Strang, Aline Venhoff and Caja Westermann. The two teachers were identified as Sonja Cercek and Stefanie Tegethoff. As news of the crash spread, the area at the entrance to the school became a makeshift memorial, filled with red and white candles, notes and swiftly-painted signs. \"Yesterday we were many, today we are alone,\" reads one. \"Why?\" demands another, with painful simplicity. Philippa, a friend of many of those who died, told CNN she was shocked by what had happened: \"I knew all of them, they were in my grade. To some I was very close. \"We had already planned things for the future, what we were going to do when they returned from their trip. It is very hard to believed that we cannot do that.\" Grief counselors, chaplains and psychologists have been brought in to the school to help all of those involved come to terms with the disaster. \"I've told the students and teachers that we have to accept the sorrow and grieve,\" said Wessel. \"I hope we will all get through it, if we share it.\" As the world's media descend on the town, messages of support have come flooding in too. The local newspaper is running an online book of condolence, in which people can leave messages of sympathy and \"light\" virtual candles to match the real ones flickering on the steps of the school. \"A silent hug says more than many words,\" wrote Manuela Donovang. \"Wishing the families, friends and relatives strength and comfort in the difficult days and months ahead.\" In his message, Udo Hentschel said the suffering of the parents, friends and families was \"incomprehensible, unfathomable\" and offered them his condolences: \"This, the worst of all fates, will bind us all -- friends and strangers -- closer together.\" In an attempt to show that solidarity, schools across the region will share a moment of silence in memory of the dead on Friday at 10:53 a.m., the time the plane crashed. For the classmates of those who will never return, that silence will go on, as the seats they left empty remain unfilled in the weeks and months to come. \"Our school is no longer what it once was,\" said Wessel. \"In Haltern we had 1,283 students.

In a post on the school's website, Wessel and other school representatives announced the names of the dead, \"who will never again return to us,\" leaving all those concerned \"unutterably sad.\" The teenagers who died were: Linda Bergjurgen, Elena Bless, Lea Druppel, Selina Eils, Gina Michelle Gerdes, Ann-Christin Hahn, Julia Hermann, Marleen Koch, Paula Lutkenhaus, Fabio Rogge, Rabea Scheideler, Lea Schukart, Helena Siebe, Steffen Strang, Aline Venhoff and Caja Westermann. The two teachers were identified as Sonja Cercek and Stefanie Tegethoff. As news of the crash spread, the area at the entrance to the school became a makeshift memorial, filled with red and white candles, notes and swiftly-painted signs. \"Yesterday we were many, today we are alone,\" reads one. \"Why?\" demands another, with painful simplicity. Philippa, a friend of many of those who died, told CNN she was shocked by what had happened: \"I knew all of them, they were in my grade. To some I was very close. \"We had already planned things for the future, what we were going to do when they returned from their trip. It is very hard to believed that we cannot do that.\" Grief counselors, chaplains and psychologists have been brought in to the school to help all of those involved come to terms with the disaster. \"I've told the students and teachers that we have to accept the sorrow and grieve,\" said Wessel. \"I hope we will all get through it, if we share it.\" As the world's media descend on the town, messages of support have come flooding in too. The local newspaper is running an online book of condolence, in which people can leave messages of sympathy and \"light\" virtual candles to match the real ones flickering on the steps of the school. \"A silent hug says more than many words,\" wrote Manuela Donovang. \"Wishing the families, friends and relatives strength and comfort in the difficult days and months ahead.\" In his message, Udo Hentschel said the suffering of the parents, friends and families was \"incomprehensible, unfathomable\" and offered them his condolences: \"This, the worst of all fates, will bind us all -- friends and strangers -- closer together.\" In an attempt to show that solidarity, schools across the region will share a moment of silence in memory of the dead on Friday at 10:53 a.m., the time the plane crashed. For the classmates of those who will never return, that silence will go on, as the seats they left empty remain unfilled in the weeks and months to come. \"Our school is no longer what it once was,\" said Wessel. \"In Haltern we had 1,283 students. It is horrifying that now we have 16 fewer.\"\nSummary:\n",

      "article": "Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to unleash a supersonic bomber towards Britain which can outrun the Royal Air Force's fastest fighter jets. The introduction of the Blackjack follows sorties by other Russian aircraft near Cornwall last month which disrupted commercial flights and sparked major security fears. On that occasion, RAF pilots flying Typhoon jets easily caught up with two propeller-driven Bear bombers and directed their crews away from UK airspace. Scroll down for video . The top speed is the same... but our range is less: British Typhoon compared to the Russian Blackjack . The incident led to Russia's ambassador to Britain being summoned to the Foreign Office to explain the mission. But the Blackjack (Tu-160M) is three times faster than the Bear and can fly four times further than the fighters that make up Britain's Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) squadrons, according to experts. The bomber, also known as the White Swan because of its shape and huge wingspan, has just re-entered service in the Russian air force following a design overhaul. Experts say it is now more than a match for any UK aircraft, including the Typhoon, which is used to protect British airspace. Like the Blackjack, the Typhoon can reach Mach 2 – about 1,500mph. Russian President Vladimir Putin (pictured) has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the West, according to experts . But while the Russian aircraft has a range of 7,600 miles without refuelling, the Typhoon's limit is 1,800 miles, meaning the Blackjack could maintain its maximum speed for much longer than its British counterpart without air-to-air refuelling. Dr Igor Sutyagin, Senior Russian Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) in London, said: ‚öÑ≤The Tu-160M now has greater thrust and fuel efficiency and it can carry a larger payload of conventional missiles. ‚öÑ≤The test flights were successful and the aircraft is now very potent. There is simply no British aircraft of its calibre or purpose. It is the largest bomber in the world.' The first two revamped Blackjacks passed a series of test flights last December and have now been passed for service. They are being prepared for possible action at air bases in Russia that are within easy striking distance of Britain. One, Monchegorsk air base near Murmansk, northern Russia, is just 1,000 miles from the British Isles. Ten more Blackjacks will be modernised before 2020. Dr Sutyagin added that the Blackjacks' revamp was part of a plan by President Putin to boost both Russia's arsenal of military hardware and its troop numbers. It comes at a time of heightened tension between Russia and the West, and while Britain's Armed Forces are shrinking due to spending cuts. ‚öÑ≤President Putin has prioritised areas of defence where he thinks he can be superior to the West,' said Dr Sutyagin. ‚öÑ≤He has also improved his long-range nuclear missiles such as the Bulava, which is now very hard to detect on launch. It is lighter and more compact, too, so more warheads can be fitted into a submarine. 'He has also committed to the T-50 low-visibility jet. This stealth jet could lead to potentially massive changes in the distribution of military power around the world. 'He is doubling the number of his Special Forces troops, as well.' An RAF Typhoon aircraft from Number XI Squadron shadows a Russian Bear-H aircraft (file picture) Between now and 2020, the size of the Spetsnaz (Special Forces) regiments will increase from 15,000 to 32,000. Trained to the same level as Britain's Special Air Service (SAS), they were used in Chechnya and, most recently, in eastern Ukraine where they are understood to have organised a guerilla campaign by Russian separatists. Experts also believe Putin could send the Spetsnaz to the Baltic states of Latvia and Lithuania, both Nato members, to organise resistance among ethnic Russians. Dr Sutyagin added: ‚öÑ≤Military activity in Crimea and eastern Ukraine has borne all the hallmarks of the special Russian units – it would be a mistake to believe the same tactics might not be applied elsewhere.' The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has been following the Blackjack and Russian stealth-jet programmes. But while the Typhoon cannot match the Blackjack's range, RAF sources insist it is a superior aircraft overall given its set of air-to-air weapons and its agility. An MoD spokesman said: ‚öÑ≤The primary role of the Royal Air Force is to defend the UK. We are aware of recent Russian military activity. 'RAF Typhoon fighters will continue to routinely intercept, identify and escort Russian aircraft that travel through international airspace within the UK's area of interest.'",

      "article": "Obesity places as great a burden on the global economy as war and terrorism, costing $2 trillion each year. A rising tide of obesity is 'a critical global issue' that requires a 'comprehensive, international intervention strategy', researchers have claimed. More than 2.1 billion people across the world - around 30 per cent of the global population - are overweight or obese. And the epidemic shows no signs of decline. Experts predict if the current prevalence of obesity continues on its current trajectory, 'almost half the world's adult population will be overweight or obese by 2030'. Obesity places as great a burden on the global economy as war and terrorism, costing $2 trillion each year, a new study by experts at the McKinsey Global Institue has found . Researchers estimated if current obesity rates continue, almost half the world's adult population will be overweight or obese by 2030 . A report by McKinsey&Company, which studied 44 different ways of combating obesity, found the global impact is the equivalent to smoking or armed violence, war and terrorism. In the UK the burden on the economy is £47 billion a year - greater than the impact of armed violence, war and terrorism - while in the U.S. it is £663 billion. The researchers have called on global governments, healthcare systems, retailers and food and drinks manufacturers to 'coordinate' their response to tackle the crisis head on. They said while the severity of the global obesity crisis is 'beyond doubt', there are interventions that are very effective. The majority of the weight-loss programmes and policies studied 'are cost-effective at a societal level and could potentially have a high impact'. Among the interventions researchers studied were subsidised school meals for all, calorie and nutrition labelling, restrictions on advertising high-calorie food and drinks, and public health campaigns. The study explored 44 different interventions being implemented across the globe, including: . They found no single intervention alone was likely to have a significant overall impact on obesity rates. Rather, 'a systemic, sustained portfolio of initiatives, delivered at scale, is needed to reverse the health burden'. While better education and personal responsibility were identified as 'critical elements' of a programme to tackle obesity, they were not sufficient on their own. Researchers said policies and steps that rely less on the conscious choices of individuals, and more on changes to their environment are needed. They include reducing default portion sizes, changing marketing practised and restructuring urban and education environments to facilitate more physical activity. The report said: 'Obesity is a major global economic problem caused by a multitude of factors. 'Today obesity is jostling with armed conflict and smoking in terms of having the greatest human-generated global economic impact. 'The global economic impact of obesity is increasing. The evidence suggests that the economic and societal impact of obesity is deep and lasting.' In the UK the burden on the economy is £47 billion a year - greater than the impact of armed violence, war and terrorism. In the U.S. the cost to the economy is $663 billion a year . In the UK, obesity has the second largest impact after smoking, while in the U.S. obesity came second to armed violence, war and terrorism, researchers found . They found obesity has the same impact on the global economy as armed conflict and terrorism, and just 'a shade less than smoking'. 'In most developed economies, obesity ranks among the top three human-generated economic burdens.' In the UK, obesity has the second largest impact after smoking, generating an economic loss of more than £44 billion a year in 2012. The report found the economic impact from smoking in the UK was £57 billion in 2012, while the country suffered a £43 billion annual loss from armed violence, war and terrorism. In the U.S. armed conflict, especially spending on the military, has the highest impact, with obesity second. Obesity cost the U.S. economy $663billion a year in 2012. They predict a series of 44 interventions could bring 20 per cent of overweight or obese people in the UK back to normal weight within five to 10 years. It would save around £16 billion a year in UK, including an annual saving of about £766 million in the NHS, according to the study. More than 2.1 billion people across the world are overweight or obese and that number is growing . One in 12 of the global adult population has type 2 diabetes, 'which is at least partly driven by obesity' The study found the UK Government's efforts to tackle obesity were 'too fragmented to be effective', while investment in obesity prevention was 'relatively low given the scale of the problem.' The UK spends less than £638 million a year on obesity prevention programmes - about 1 per cent of the country's social cost of obesity, researchers said. But the country spends about £6 billion a year on the medical costs of conditions related to being overweight or obese and a further £10 billion on diabetes. Meanwhile, the cost of obesity and diabetes to the NHS is equivalent to the UK's combined 'protection' budget for the police and fire services, law courts, and prisons. The current rate of obesity and overweight conditions suggest the cost to the NHS could increase from between £6 billion and £8 billion in 2015 to between £10 billion and £12 billion in 2030, the study found. But the authors acknowledge combating obesity 'will not be easy'. For fast action, that is effective, the researchers said more co-operation is needed between public and private sectors. They said: 'They (authorities) cannot focus too heavily on debating which interventions should be prioritised and they should be prepared to engage in trial and error to reach an understanding of which approaches are likely to be most effective. 'We see the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle being more investment in obesity prevention and in research.' Overall obesity prevalence appears to be linked to a country's wealth, the researchers found. Among the G-20 nations with per capital GDP exceeding $8,000, only Japan and South Korea have prevalence rates lower than 16 per cent. The majority of G-20 countries have rates of more than 20 per cent . 'There is huge scope to rein in the rising trend of obesity acorss the world - and to do so ina cost-effective way. 'Above all, boldness is imperative. Nothing else with mitigate the huge and rising human, social and economic costs of this crisis.' MGI director Richard Dobbs said: 'Efforts to address obesity have been piecemeal up till now. 'Yet obesity is a systemic issue, born of many interlocking factors, and only a systemic response will do.' Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at Public Health England, said: 'Overweight and obesity is a complex problem which requires action across individual and societal levels involving industry, national and local government and the voluntary sector. There is no single 'silver bullet' solution. 'Today 25 per cent of the nation is obese and 37 per cent is overweight. If we reduce obesity to 1993 levels, where 15 per cent of the population were obese, we will avoid five million disease cases and save the NHS alone an additional £1.2 billion by 2034. 'PHE will continue to support local authorities to provide effective weight management services, to influence the regulation of fast food outlets and provide healthier catering in hospitals and schools, which will all help people to lose weight.' Professor Jimmy Bell, an obesity expert at the University of Westminster, said he believes the report 'shockingly' underestimates the total cost of obesity. He said it fails to include the spiralling costs to companies and Governments for accommodating overweight and obese people. The study examined the effects of 44 different interventions to help reduce obesity levels, including healthier school meals and investing in parental education . He said: 'Hospital beds and ambulances now need to be strengthened to carry overweight people and even buses, trains, airplanes and entertainment venues need to install bigger and reinforced seating to cope with a society growing in size. 'Governments need to replicate laws imposed on the tobacco industry to label food highlighting the life threatening dangers of consuming products with a high fat, calorie and sugar content; otherwise the obesity situation will get much worse. 'The global food supply is not inexhaustible and the current increase in demand is unsustainable. People in emerging markets, particularly Asia, are now consuming larger more calorific helpings of food and demand may soon exceed supply. 'Obese people are also likely to have obese pets due to over feeding and lack of exercise.'",

The soldier who helped propel Ron Paul into third place in Iowa allegedly violated military rules by wearing his uniform on the candidate's podium. Army Corporal Jesse Thorsen, 28, of West Des Moines, Iowa, has been a visible presence with the Texas Representative throughout his campaign. U.S. military rules allow active-duty soldiers to support political candidates but they are banned from doing so as an armed forces representative. Scroll down for videos . Support: U.S. Army Corporal Jesse Thorsen, right, cheers on GOP presidential candidate Texas Rep. Ron Paul, left, in Ankeny, Iowa, on Tuesday . ‚öÑ≤I'm really excited about a lot of his ideas, especially when it comes to bringing the soldiers home,' Corporal Thorsen told CNN in an interview. ‚öÑ≤I've been serving for ten years now and all ten years of those have been during wartime. I would like to see a little peace time army.' The 10-year Iraq and Afghanistan veteran has already served abroad twice and has a 9/11 tattoo with ‚öÑ≤Remember' and a Twin Towers picture. CNN reporter Dana Bash then told him that some Republicans think Mr Paul's ideas are dangerous because he wants to bring U.S. troops home. Big fan: Mr Paul shakes hands with U.S. Army Corporal Thorsen as he greets various supporters at his Iowa caucus night rally in Ankeny on Tuesday . ‚öÑ≤I think it would be even more dangerous to start nit-picking wars with other countries,' Corporal Thorson replied to Ms Bash. 'I'm really excited about a lot of his ideas, especially when it comes to bringing the soldiers home' Jesse Thorsen . He then went on to say ‚öÑ≤someone like Iran, Israel is more than capable of‚öÑ∂' before the video feed cut out and returned to host Wolf Blitzer. Conspiracy theorists have claimed the soldier was cut off because producers thought he ‚öÑ≤was too smart for his own good', reported Mediaite. The soldier was in fact breaking military rules by wearing his uniform while endorsing Mr Paul on camera and on stage, reported the Huffington Post. The Defense Department Directive 1344.10 (4.1.1.9) says an active-duty serviceman can only attend political activities ‚öÑ≤when not in uniform'.

Corporal Thorsen was clearly endorsing Mr Paul on camera and on stage when he was invited by the candidate to speak at his rally. 'How about Ron Paul,' Corporal Thorsen told the crowd on CNN. ‚öÑ≤If there's any man out there who's had a vision for this country it is definitely him. 'His foreign policy is by far hands down better than any candidates out there,' he added. ‚öÑ≤We don't need to be picking fights overseas.'

      "article": "(CNN) -- The World Health Organization on Friday reported 2,500 confirmed cases of swine flu in 25 countries, with 44 deaths from the disease. A researcher investigates swine flu at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. In the United States, the total number of confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus, as swine flu is officially called, nearly doubled to 1,639 from the day before, with reports coming from 43 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The U.S. Navy said Friday that 12 crew members aboard the USS Dubuque have been diagnosed with swine flu. The amphibious transport dock ship had been due to deploy on June 1 to the South Pacific on a humanitarian mission, Cmdr. Joseph Surette, a Navy spokesman, said Tuesday. The ship was being scrubbed and disinfected, and its remaining 370 crew members were given Tamiflu as a precaution, Surette said. Navy officials said the ship could still be deployed in an emergency, but would remain in port in San Diego, California, until commanders determine the crew is suitable to deploy. Dr. Sylvie Briand, acting director of the Global Influenza Program for the World Health Organization, said the agency will remain at pandemic alert level 5 -- one step away from its highest level -- because while there are an increasing number of cases, there is no evidence of the community transmission outside North America that would push the alert to level 6. Of the 44 deaths reported, two were in the United States and 42 in Mexico, which has the highest concentration of swine flu cases, with more than 1,100. President Obama, speaking on the H1N1 virus during a town hall meeting for Latinos, said Americans should continue to take basic precautions such as frequently washing their hands. He also said the country should prepare for a particularly tough flu season this fall. \"The virus may not have been as virulent as we once feared, but we're not out of the woods yet,\" Obama said. Briand of WHO said many of the new cases being reported are imported -- returning travelers bringing them into their countries -- and cases resulting from close contact with those already infected, such as family members. Meanwhile, Britain's health secretary announced Friday that his country's Health Protection Agency has sequenced the full genetic code of the H1N1 virus, the first step in producing a European prototype of a swine flu vaccine. \"This is critical in understanding how the virus operates and identifying the crucial parts of the virus that can be used in vaccine manufacture,\" said a statement from the agency. \"Researchers hope that European manufacturers will be able to take delivery of candidate vaccine prototypes in the coming months so preliminary steps to mass vaccine production can begin,\" the statement said.",

      "article": "(CNN) -- Two men have been arrested in California in connection with a string of brazen attacks in the past six months thought to be targeting law enforcement. Nicholas Smit, 40, is being held on allegations of making a booby trap, assault with intent to murder a police officer and possession of a firearm while on bail, Hemet Police Chief Richard Dana said Saturday. Also arrested was Steve Hansen, 36, for possession of a firearm while on parole. Authorities are investigating whether he may be involved in seven attacks believed to have targeted members of the Hemet Police Department since December. No one has been injured in the attacks. The arrests came after police served search warrants on the men's homes in Hemet and Homeland on Friday night, Dana said. At least two more suspects are being sought, and a $200,000 reward for information in the case is up for grabs as the investigation continues, he added. The police chief would not comment directly on a possible motive but said one of the suspects made comments during his arrest suggesting that \"he doesn't like us very much,\" Dana said. The arrests come less than a week after a suspected arson damaged a police evidence lab, the latest attack aimed at the department, according to authorities. The booby trap-style attacks have drawn the attention of state and federal law enforcement agencies, which have contributed manpower to the investigation and money to the $200,000 reward. \"Clearly, an attack on one community is an attack on all communities. By the same token, an attack on a police officer puts all of the public at risk, no matter where they live,\" said Riverside County Sheriff Stanley Sniff Jr., whose department is participating in the investigation. Authorities have not been able to directly connect the attacks to a particular gang or organized crime, Dana said, even though most of the attacks have targeted members of an organized crime task force. Hemet is one of eight local, state and federal agencies that make up the Riverside County Gang Task Force, which was formed in 2006 to address the growth of criminal street gangs and outlaw motorcycle gangs. The attacks began in December, when, police say, a natural gas line was rerouted into the task force's headquarters, risking an explosion. On February 23, a task force member at the Hemet headquarters opened a security gate outside the building, which launched a homemade zip gun attached to the gate. The weapon fired, missing the officer's head by inches. Subsequent incidents included four city vehicles being set ablaze in the City Hall parking lot and a suspected arson at a police shooting range. \"My personal opinion is that the same people are connected with all of them, but the investigation is not over,\" Dana said.",

      "article": "Huge reserves of the oldest water on Earth are locked deep within the planet's crust and could be home to new forms of life, according to scientists. Geologists have revealed that they have found water that is up to 2.7 billion years old in sites all over the world. They now estimate that there could be around 2.5 million cubic miles (11 cubic million km) of this water buried beneath the ground. Scroll down for video . Ancient water rich in hydrogen was found to be bubbling to the surface in a gold mine in South Africa . This is more than all of the world's rivers, swamps and lakes put together. The scientists have also found tantalising hints that the highly salty water, which is spread out through tiny vein-like networks through the rock, could be home to life. The water appears to be reacting with the rock to produce large quantities of hydrogen in a similar way to what occurs around deep sea vents. Most people would think twice about consuming something that has been hanging around for more than 2.5 billion years - making it older than some mountain ranges. But Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar could not resist having a taste. Speaking to the Los Angeles Times, she described it as tasting 'terrible' due to the high salt content. Reactions between the water and rock have made the water extremely salty and rich in minerals. She said: 'It is more viscous than tap water. 'It has the consistency of a very light maple syrup. 'It doesn't have color when it comes out, but as soon as it comes into contact with oxygen it turns an orangy color because the minerals in it begin to form ‚öÑÆ especially the iron.' 'It tastes terrible. It is much saltier than seawater. You would definitely not want to drink this stuff.' They claim that this means the water trapped within the Earth's crust has the potential to support life. Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar, a geologist at the University of Toronto, who led the work along with colleagues from Oxford University, said: 'This represents a quantum change in our understanding of the total volume of the Earth's crust that may be habitable. 'It provides a \"treasure map\" of just how many other places on the planet we might want to do hunting for these microbes.' The researchers took samples of water trapped inside the Precambrian shield rocks - the oldest rocks in the Earth's crust - from 19 different mines in Canada, South Africa and Scandinavia. Here they were able to build up estimates for just how much water might be stored down the tiny cracks and pores that have formed in the ancient granite, basalt and quartzite rocks. Such Precambrian rocks make up around 70 per cent of the Earth's crust. In one zinc and copper mine in Timmins, Ontario, the ancient water has been bubbling up to the surface for decades. Noble gas isotopes, which accumulate in the water over time, have allowed the researchers to estimate the age of this water. They believe it has been trapped in the rock for more than a billion years and could even be up to 2.7 billion years old, when the rocks first formed. The researchers estimated the amount of hydrogen being produced by reactions between rocks in the precambrian crust (exposed rock is marked blue while buried rock is marked green) after taking samples of water from mines (marked by yellow dots) in Canada, South Africa, Scandinavia and around Europe . Professor Sherwood Lollar said: 'The waters show us an incredible spectrum of residence times - from tens of thousands of years in age near the surface, to tens of millions of years residence time in the deep gold mines of South Africa, and last year we reported on waters form the Canadian Shield with more than a billion years residence time. 'Investigating them all and finding out where life occurs and how much it differs from one fracture to another will be an extraordinary adventure over the coming years.' She said that the huge quantities of hydrogen rich water in the Earth's crust was a 'sleeping giant' that could be a source of possible energy for life. Water trapped within tiny veins in ancient rock can preserve chemicals from the environment long ago . In 2006 scientists discovered rock and chemical eating bacteria living in Gold mines in South Africa, 1.7 miles (2.8km) under ground. Here the microbes were found to be using hydrogen and sulfates to survive in the salty water that filled tiny fractures. Similar types of bacteria have been found living in the hydrothermal vents that form on the sea bed, allowing entire ecosystems to flourish. Professor Sherwood Lollar and her colleagues believe that there could be entirely new undiscovered forms of life and ancient bacteria living in the viscous salt waters that leak through the oldest rocks in the Earth's crust. Their work, which is published in the journal Nature and was also presented at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union, could also provide clues about where life on Mars, if it exists, could be found. Mars surface consists of rocks that are billions of years old and have the potential to produce hydrogen in the same way as those on Earth. Barbara Sherwood Lollar says she has tasted the water as it is a quick way of finding the saltiest samples . Researchers took samples of the highly salty water in 19 mines around the world to test for hydrogen content . Another recent discovery of flourishing colonies of slow growing bacteria in seams of coal, 8000 feet below the sea bed off the coast of Japan. Professor Sherwood Lollar said: 'If the ancient rocks of Earth are producing this much hydrogen, it may be that similar processes are taking place on Mars.' Her colleague, Professor Christ Ballentine, from the University of Oxford, said it was a surprise to find so much water preserved under ground. He said: 'When you think about what's down beneath your feet, it's more exciting than just some rock. 'Until our most recent work, the hydrogen production in the continental crust was calculated to be negligible. 'This was very wrong and our work shows the hydrogen production in the continental crust to be the equal to that produced in the oceanic crust. 'This doubles the estimate of hydrogen produced on Earth.' A new study has suggested that geological processes could have been responsible for helping to create much of the water on the Earth's surface. While some scientists believe water was first brought to our planet by icy comets from elsewhere int he solar system, Researchers at Ohio State University believe that the early Earth had entire oceans-worth of water trapped in its interior and these have been continually released to the surface by plate tectonics. They believe that the huge pressures on rocks deep inside the Earth's mantle are actually squeezing water out from the dry rock by forcing hydrogen and oxygen atoms trapped inside minerals there to combine. In laboratory experiments, Professor Wendy Panero, an earth scientist at Ohio State University, has been compressing minerals that are common in the Earth's mantel to subject them to high pressures and temperatures. In a paper they presented at the American Geophysical Union fall meeting, they reported how recent tests of the mineral bridgmanite, the most abundant mineral in the lower mantel, does not contain enough hydrogen to play an important role in the Earth's water supply, but two other minerals called Ringwoodite and garnet may. 'If all of the Earth's water is on the surface, that gives us one interpretation of the water cycle, where we can think of water cycling from oceans into the atmosphere and into the groundwater over millions of years,\" said Professor Panero. 'But if mantle circulation is also part of the water cycle, the total cycle time for our planet's water has to be billions of years. 'When we look into the origins of water on Earth, what we're really asking is, why are we so different than all the other planets? 'In this solar system, Earth is unique because we have liquid water on the surface. We're also the only planet with active plate tectonics. 'Maybe this water in the mantle is key to plate tectonics, and that's part of what makes Earth habitable.'",

Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar, a geologist at the University of Toronto, who led the work along with colleagues from Oxford University, said: 'This represents a quantum change in our understanding of the total volume of the Earth's crust that may be habitable. 'It provides a \"treasure map\" of just how many other places on the planet we might want to do hunting for these microbes.' The researchers took samples of water trapped inside the Precambrian shield rocks - the oldest rocks in the Earth's crust - from 19 different mines in Canada, South Africa and Scandinavia. Here they were able to build up estimates for just how much water might be stored down the tiny cracks and pores that have formed in the ancient granite, basalt and quartzite rocks. Such Precambrian rocks make up around 70 per cent of the Earth's crust. In one zinc and copper mine in Timmins, Ontario, the ancient water has been bubbling up to the surface for decades. Noble gas isotopes, which accumulate in the water over time, have allowed the researchers to estimate the age of this water. They believe it has been trapped in the rock for more than a billion years and could even be up to 2.7 billion years old, when the rocks first formed. The researchers estimated the amount of hydrogen being produced by reactions between rocks in the precambrian crust (exposed rock is marked blue while buried rock is marked green) after taking samples of water from mines (marked by yellow dots) in Canada, South Africa, Scandinavia and around Europe . Professor Sherwood Lollar said: 'The waters show us an incredible spectrum of residence times - from tens of thousands of years in age near the surface, to tens of millions of years residence time in the deep gold mines of South Africa, and last year we reported on waters form the Canadian Shield with more than a billion years residence time. 'Investigating them all and finding out where life occurs and how much it differs from one fracture to another will be an extraordinary adventure over the coming years.' She said that the huge quantities of hydrogen rich water in the Earth's crust was a 'sleeping giant' that could be a source of possible energy for life. Water trapped within tiny veins in ancient rock can preserve chemicals from the environment long ago . In 2006 scientists discovered rock and chemical eating bacteria living in Gold mines in South Africa, 1.7 miles (2.8km) under ground. Here the microbes were found to be using hydrogen and sulfates to survive in the salty water that filled tiny fractures. Similar types of bacteria have been found living in the hydrothermal vents that form on the sea bed, allowing entire ecosystems to flourish. Professor Sherwood Lollar and her colleagues believe that there could be entirely new undiscovered forms of life and ancient bacteria living in the viscous salt waters that leak through the oldest rocks in the Earth's crust. Their work, which is published in the journal Nature and was also presented at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union, could also provide clues about where life on Mars, if it exists, could be found. Mars surface consists of rocks that are billions of years old and have the potential to produce hydrogen in the same way as those on Earth. Barbara Sherwood Lollar says she has tasted the water as it is a quick way of finding the saltiest samples . Researchers took samples of the highly salty water in 19 mines around the world to test for hydrogen content . Another recent discovery of flourishing colonies of slow growing bacteria in seams of coal, 8000 feet below the sea bed off the coast of Japan. Professor Sherwood Lollar said: 'If the ancient rocks of Earth are producing this much hydrogen, it may be that similar processes are taking place on Mars.' Her colleague, Professor Christ Ballentine, from the University of Oxford, said it was a surprise to find so much water preserved under ground. He said: 'When you think about what's down beneath your feet, it's more exciting than just some rock. 'Until our most recent work, the hydrogen production in the continental crust was calculated to be negligible. 'This was very wrong and our work shows the hydrogen production in the continental crust to be the equal to that produced in the oceanic crust. 'This doubles the estimate of hydrogen produced on Earth.' A new study has suggested that geological processes could have been responsible for helping to create much of the water on the Earth's surface. While some scientists believe water was first brought to our planet by icy comets from elsewhere int he solar system, Researchers at Ohio State University believe that the early Earth had entire oceans-worth of water trapped in its interior and these have been continually released to the surface by plate tectonics. They believe that the huge pressures on rocks deep inside the Earth's mantle are actually squeezing water out from the dry rock by forcing hydrogen and oxygen atoms trapped inside minerals there to combine. In laboratory experiments, Professor Wendy Panero, an earth scientist at Ohio State University, has been compressing minerals that are common in the Earth's mantel to subject them to high pressures and temperatures. In a paper they presented at the American Geophysical Union fall meeting, they reported how recent tests of the mineral bridgmanite, the most abundant mineral in the lower mantel, does not contain enough hydrogen to play an important role in the Earth's water supply, but two other minerals called Ringwoodite and garnet may. 'If all of the Earth's water is on the surface, that gives us one interpretation of the water cycle, where we can think of water cycling from oceans into the atmosphere and into the groundwater over millions of years,\" said Professor Panero. 'But if mantle circulation is also part of the water cycle, the total cycle time for our planet's water has to be billions of years. 'When we look into the origins of water on Earth, what we're really asking is, why are we so different than all the other planets? 'In this solar system, Earth is unique because we have liquid water on the surface. We're also the only planet with active plate tectonics. 'Maybe this water in the mantle is key to plate tectonics, and that's part of what makes Earth habitable.'\nSummary:\n",

      "summary1": "The global average atmospheric carbon dioxide in 2019 was 409.8 parts per million (ppm for short), with a range of uncertainty of plus or minus 0.1 ppm. Carbon dioxide levels today are higher than at any point in at least the past 800,000 years.In fact, the last time the atmospheric CO‚öáá amounts were this high was more than 3 million years ago, when temperature was 2¨‚àû–3¨‚àûC (3.6¨‚àû–5.4¨‚àûF) higher than during the pre-industrial era, and sea level was 15–25 meters (50–80 feet) higher than today.Carbon dioxide concentrations are rising mostly because of the fossil fuels that people are burning for energy. Fossil fuels like coal and oil contain carbon that plants pulled out of the atmosphere through photosynthesis over the span of many millions of years; we are returning that carbon to the atmosphere in just a few hundred years. According to State of the Climate in 2019 from NOAA and the American Meteorological Society, Global atmospheric carbon dioxide was 409.8 ± 0.1 ppm in 2019, a new record high. That is an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm from 2018, the same as the increase between 2017 and 2018. In the 1960s, the global growth rate of atmospheric carbon dioxide was roughly 0.6 ± 0.1 ppm per year. Between 2009-18, however, the growth rate has been 2.3 ppm per year. The annual rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide over the past 60 years is about 100 times faster than previous natural increases, such as those that occurred at the end of the last ice age 11,000-17,000 years ago. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas: a gas that absorbs and radiates heat. Warmed by sunlight, Earth's land and ocean surfaces continuously radiate thermal infrared energy (heat). Unlike oxygen or nitrogen (which make up most of our atmosphere), greenhouse gases absorb that heat and release it gradually over time, like bricks in a fireplace after the fire goes out. Without this natural greenhouse effect, Earth's average annual temperature would be below freezing instead of close to 60¨‚àûF. But increases in greenhouse gases have tipped the Earth's energy budget out of balance, trapping additional heat and raising Earth's average temperature.",

The Red crested early on the morning of April 7 at Fargo at 34.2 foot stage (present [1952] datum) exceeding the known high levels of 1871, 1873, and 1882. The Sheyenne River, by April 8, was up so high that water flowed overland from it to the Wild Rice River. The flood of 1897 at Fargo covered most of the business and residential areas of the city.The present indications are that we will have high water this spring, as high if not higher, than it was in the spring of 1861. If all reports are true there is more snow on the level now than there was in the spring of 1861. That year the entire valley was flooded from Big Stone Lake to Winnipeg, a distance of more than 300 miles. There are but four men living in the valley now that witnessed the great flood of '61 -- the largest body of fresh water in the world at that time * * * R. M. Probesfield is authority for saying that he, a few days ago, measured the snow in his timber, where it was free from drifting and it measured 5 feet.

      "article": "An unmarried woman yesterday won a share of her ex-boyfriend's money after they split. Catherine Blackburn will get £28,500 from the man with whom she shared a house in a landmark court ruling for cohabiting couples. Appeal Court judges said the 54-year-old deserved support because she had been promised a ‚öÑ≤home for life' by insurance manager David Southwell – who then left her homeless by changing the locks after they broke up. David Southwell and his ex-girlfriend Catherine Blackburn pictured on holiday before they split up. He has been ordered to pay Miss Blackburn £28,500 in a landmark legal decision for unmarried couples . Even though he paid for the mortgage on the £240,000 home, justices said she was ‚öÑ≤effectively a wife' and sacrificed the value of her own property when she moved in with him. The case comes as senior judges are calling for new legal rights for cohabitees who can be left without a home and out of pocket when a relationship ends. But it leaves men who live with partners facing the prospect of having to pay compensation to a girlfriend if they break up. Yesterday Mr Southwell, 55, called the ruling ‚öÑ≤ridiculous', claiming he had single-handedly funded their lifestyle. ‚öÑ≤I paid for virtually everything and she did not put a penny towards the house,' he said. ‚öÑ≤I paid her mobile phone bill. I bought her a brand new car. ‚öÑ≤She went to university because she wanted to study to be a speech and language therapist. She doubled her salary as a result of the degree. Whilst she was at university I was putting £500 a month into her account. The couple lived in a £240,000 house for which Mr Southwell paid the mortgage however the court heard Miss Blackburn was 'effectively a wife' Mr Southwell described the case as 'ridiculous' and claimed it could 'open the floodgates' to other unmarried couples . Lawyers have pressed for two decades for cohabitees to have the same rights as married couples. The Law Commission says a childless couple should be bound to support each other after living together for five years. But critics say it would unfairly bind people together and prove costly for those involved in litigation – and governments have so far declined to act. James Brown of JMW Solicitors described yesterday's judgment as a ‚öÑ≤significant development'. He added: ‚öÑ≤What is important about this ruling is not just that it might make it easier to succeed with this kind of claim in the future. ‚öÑ≤It might act as something of a temptation for cohabitees who had possibly not considered legal redress once their relationships break down.' It could also give couples ‚öÑ≤a reason to think again' about living together, added Mr Brown. ‚öÑ≤It has been ridiculous. The case has now cost me more than £100,000, including my costs, just to give her £28,500.' He added: ‚öÑ≤I think it is a wake-up call for all cohabiting couples. It could open the floodgates.' The pair met in 2000 and decided to move in together two years later. They made a joint decision, the courts decided, to buy a house in Droitwich with £140,000 of Mr Southwell's money and a £100,000 mortgage in his name, which he paid. Judges heard that Mr Southwell did not want to marry because he did not want to have to pay maintenance in the event of a break-up. Instead, the court found, he assured Miss Blackburn and her two daughters from an earlier marriage they would always have a home – although he insists that meant as long as the relationship lasted. Lord Justice Tomlinson, sitting with Lord Justice McFarlane and Lady Justice Macur, said Miss Blackburn enjoyed benefits including a ‚öÑ≤rent-free' home. She was also given ‚öÑ≤considerable' help to qualify as a speech and language therapist that enhanced her earning ability', the judges said. The case was heard at the Court of Appeal at the Royal Courts of Justice in London (pictured) However, Mr Southwell benefited from the support of someone who was ‚öÑ≤effectively a wife' and who ‚öÑ≤shouldered the major housekeeping activities', the court heard. The relationship came to a ‚öÑ≤messy' end in 2012 and Miss Blackburn and her daughters found themselves homeless after the locks of the house were changed, it was said. Appeal judges awarded Miss Blackburn a payout under the property law principle of promissory estoppel, which covers promises to someone that they can use a property. They said she should be compensated for the £15,000 she had put into a rented home she gave up to move in with Mr Southwell, together with the £5,000 she had contributed to the Droitwich house, together with an allowance for inflation. Miss Blackburn last night said she hoped the landmark court ruling would help other women in her position. She said: ‚öÑ≤I paid some utility bills, I paid for food, I paid for items for the house.' Of Mr Southwell's decision to put the house in his name, she added: ‚öÑ≤I trusted him and believed everything he said, thinking I would be secure. ‚öÑ≤He seemed very genuine.

      "article": "As soon as Jose Mourinho declared Chelsea's Capital One Cup final against Tottenham as the most important final of his distinguished managerial career, it was hard to see past The Special One's side. And that could, in part, be down to the Chelsea manager's brilliant record in cup finals: he's lost just one final across 11 full seasons as a coach, winning 10 along the way plus seven league titles and four Community Shields or Super Cups. That makes it 21 trophies across 727 games, an average of a winner's medal every 35 matches. Jose Mourinho holds the Capital One Cup aloft, it is the 21st trophy of his career as a manager . The Portuguese coach lifts the cup in delight, and he believes 'finals are not for playing, they are for winning' The ecstatic Chelsea boss showed a contrasting mood to the miserable figure from recent press conferences .

'Finals are not for playing, they are for winning,' Mourinho said at full-time at Wembley, and he certainly believes in his own words given the impressive record he holds on show-piece occasions like Sunday. Victory over Spurs ended a two-year mini-drought for Mourinho, having come through a difficult final season at Real Madrid before failing in all three cup competitions and finishing third in the Barclays Premier League with Chelsea last season. That was his longest stretch without a trophy while in constant employment as a manager - and Sunday marked his first cup final success in almost four years. The only final that a Mourinho-led team has been beaten in came in 2013's Copa de Rey final when Real Madrid were defeated 2-1 by local rivals Atletico Madrid - and even then it took extra time to kill off Mourinho. Prior to that though, he had won all nine of his previous finals, picking up the Taca de Portugal, UEFA Cup and Champions League with Porto, two Carling Cups and an FA Cup in his first spell at Chelsea, a Coppa Italia and Champions League with Inter Milan and a Copa del Rey with Real.

      "article": "(CNN)A few years ago, Glyzelle Palomar was begging for food on the streets of northern Manila. This week, the 12-year-old girl was on a stage in front of tens of thousands of people, asking Pope Francis why God lets children suffer. \"There are many children neglected by their own parents,\" Glyzelle said Sunday at a ceremony at a 400-year-old Catholic university in Manila. \"There are also many who became victims and many terrible things happened to them like drugs or prostitution.\" \"Why is God allowing such things to happen, even if it is not the fault of the children?\" she asked the Pope, breaking down into tears as she spoke. Another former street child, Jun Chura, told Pope Francis about his struggle to survive without a home. \"I was feeding myself with what I can find in the garbage,\" said Jun, 14. \"I did not know where to go, and I was sleeping on the sidewalk.\" \"When I was in the street, I witness also things I don't like, terrible things that happened to my companions in the street,\" Jun said. \"I saw that they were taught how to steal, to kill also, and they have no respect anymore for the adults.\" Pope Francis responded to Glyzelle's question and Jun's testimony by giving the two children a big hug. \"She is the only one who has put a question for which there is no answer and she wasn't even able to express it in words but in tears,\" the 78-year-old Pope told the crowd. Glyzelle and Jun are both in the care of Tulay ng Kabataan Foundation, a non-governmental organization that looks after Manila's street children. The foundation came across Glyzelle and her older sister a few years ago, said Alexandra Chapeleau, the group's communication manager. The girls had left home -- where their impoverished parents were unable to support them or get them an education -- and were fending for themselves on the street, she said. They first attended one of the foundation's drop-in centers before moving into a residential facility and starting to attend school. In November, their younger brother joined them at the foundation. Glyzelle is still in touch with her mother and goes home to see her at Christmas, Chapeleau said. The foundation's center where Glyzelle lives is home to about 40 other former street children. \"Most of them are victims of the terrible things that can happen in the street,\" including physical and sexual abuse, Chapeleau said. But Glyzelle's tears in front of the Pope on Sunday were apparently prompted by the intensity of the moment, not because of her own experiences. She asked the question \"on behalf of all the children we take care of,\" not because of \"something personal regarding her own story,\" Chapeleau said. The Pope touched on the street children theme again later Sunday when he celebrated Mass in a Manila park with millions of people, despite the soaking rain. \"We need to see each child as a gift to be welcomed, cherished and protected,\" he told the enormous crowd. \"And we need to care for our young, not allowing them to be condemned to a life on the streets.\" The Pope had visited the center where Glyzelle and others live on Friday after celebrating Mass at Manila Cathedral, and reportedly said he was \"very moved\" by what he saw. There are estimated to be more than 1.5 million street children in the Philippines, about 70,000 of them in the Manila metropolitan area, according to the He Cares Foundation, another group that cares for them. In his account, Jun described seeing some of his friends sniffing glue and taking other drugs. He said he learned to be wary of adults offering money or help because it was often a trap to exploit the children. He initially declined an offer of support from Tulay ng Kabataan Foundation but later found out that the organization was genuinely trying to help him. \"I realized that not all people have no heart,\" he said. The Pope left the Philippines on Monday, waving as he boarded his plane at the end of an Asia trip that also included time in Sri Lanka. In the first visit by a Pope to the predominantly Catholic Philippines in 20 years, Francis paid a visit to Tacloban, the city ravaged by Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013. Francis had to cut short his time there at the weekend because of the approach of another typhoon. But it didn't stop him from donning a slicker to celebrate Mass in Tacloban on Saturday for hundreds of thousands who gathered despite the stormy weather.",

      "article": "The White House threatened Wednesday to veto a Republican bill to overhaul the widely criticized No Child Left Behind law, calling the effort 'a significant step backwards.' The veto threat came as lawmakers began debate on the measure in the House. A vote is expected on Friday. Republicans say the bill would restore local control in schools and stop top-down education mandates. Democrats say it would allow billions in federal dollars to flow out without ensuring they will improve student learning. The White House threatened Wednesday to veto a Republican bill to overhaul the widely criticized No Child Left Behind law, calling the effort 'a significant step backwards' The bill maintains annual federal testing requirements. It consolidates or eliminates many federal programs, creates a single local grant program and allows public money to follow low-income children to different public schools. It would also prohibit the federal education secretary from demanding changes to state standards or imposing conditions on states in exchange for a waiver around federal law. Democratic Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia said the bill would allow states to redirect federal funds away from districts with high concentrations of poor students. 'In other words, the low-income areas would get less, the wealthy areas would get more,' Scott said. 'If that's the solution, I wonder what you think the problem was.' The White House said it was opposed to the bill because it 'abdicates the historic federal role in elementary and secondary education of ensuring the educational progress of all of America's students, including students from low-income families, students with disabilities, English learners, and students of color.' Furthermore, the bill 'fails to identify opportunity gaps or remedy inequities in access to the resources,' the White House said. The statement was the latest in a series of veto threats issued by President Barack Obama since both chambers of Congress went under Republican control last month. House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio called the education measure 'a good conservative bill that empowers America and does not empower the bureaucracy here in Washington.' 'If you step back and look at what the president's doing, the president's trying to protect the bureaucracy here in Washington,' he said in a statement. 'We're for an opportunity society and empowering people around America to do their best and to empower them to get the education that'll help them be successful in life.' At a news conference Wednesday, Boehner called education 'the civil right of the 21st century.' The measure, pushed by Education Committee Chairman John Kline, of Minnesota, would provide states and local communities greater flexibility over how 'federal dollars are used to educate America's kids,' Boehner said. Kline said education can be the 'great equalizer' in America, but only if schools succeed. About 1 in 5 students drops out of high school, and many who do graduate enter college or the workforce with subpar education, Kline said. He decried federal mandates that dictate how to gauge student achievement, define qualified teachers and spend money. 'We need to place less faith in the secretary of education and more faith in parents, teachers and state and local leaders,' he said. Speaker of the House John Boehner accused the president on Wednesday of 'trying to protect the bureaucracy here in Washington.' Republicans, he said, are for empowering people around America to do their best and to empower them to get the education that'll help them be successful in life' The bipartisan No Child Left Behind law President George W. Bush signed in 2002 sought to close significant gaps in the achievement of historically underserved group of students and their more affluent peers. It mandated annual testing in reading and math for students in grades three to eight and again in high school. Schools had to show student growth or face consequences. No Child Left Behind required that all students be able to read and do math at grade level by 2014. The Obama administration in 2012 began allowing waivers around some of the law's more stringent requirements if schools agreed to certain conditions, like using college- and career-ready standards such as Common Core. House Republican leaders view the bill as a way to show their opposition to the Obama administration's encouragement of the Common Core state standards. The standards have been adopted in more than 40 states and spell out what English and math skills students should master at each level. They have become a political issue in many states because they are viewed by critics as a federal effort even though they were developed by U.S. governors. In the Senate, there appears to be more of a bipartisan effort to fix the law. Republican Sen.

      "article": "(CNN) -- Tests of a Louisiana parish's water supply confirmed the presence of a rare brain-eating amoeba blamed for last month's death of a 4-year-old boy. The state's Department of Health & Hospitals said Thursday that tests conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found Naegleria fowleri in St. Bernard Parish water. The water is safe to drink, state officials said, although they cautioned against getting water in the nose. Naegleria fowleri is found in hot springs and warm fresh water, most often in the Southeastern United States. The amoeba enters the body through the nose and travels to the brain. There is no danger of infection from drinking or cooking with contaminated water, the CDC said. Infected patients are diagnosed with primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. The parish water supply came under suspicion because its chlorine levels were low. Chlorine kills the amoeba, said Assistant Health Secretary J.T. Lane. Naegleria fowleri associated with disinfected public drinking water has caused deaths in only one other case in the United States, according to the CDC. The water came from an untreated, geothermal well-supplied drinking water system in Arizona; two children died there in 2003. Lane said the Louisiana parish, along the Gulf Coast southeast of New Orleans, began flushing water lines with chlorine last week, a process that will continue for weeks until chlorine levels reach recommended levels. A Mississippi boy who had played on a water slide made out of a long sheet of plastic while visiting St. Bernard Parish contracted amoebic meningoencephalitis and died last month. Tests at the home where he was playing found the Naegleria fowleri amoeba. Officials said less than 1% of patients survive the deadly brain infection caused by this amoeba. But an experimental drug from the CDC has shown promise in fighting it. Kali Hardig, a 12-year-old in Arkansas, survived after contracting the amoeba in July, possibly at a Little Rock, Arkansas, water park. Doctors credited Kali's mom, Traci Hardig, with her survival, saying she brought her daughter to the hospital early and pushed for more tests. \"If you believe that there's something more wrong with your daughter or your son than a simple virus or stomach flu, stay in there, hang in there,\" Hardig told CNN. \"Talk to the doctor ... and reassure them that this is not a normal illness.\" The first symptoms of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis appear one to seven days after infection, including headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck, according to the CDC. \"Later symptoms include confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations,\" the government agency's website says. \"After the start of symptoms, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within one to 12 days.\" Here are some tips from the CDC to help lower the risk of infection: . ‚öÑ¢ Avoid swimming in fresh water when the water temperature is high and the water level is low. ‚öÑ¢ Hold your nose shut or use nose clips while swimming. ‚öÑ¢ Avoid stirring up the sediment while wading in shallow, warm freshwater areas. ‚öÑ¢ If you are irrigating, flushing or rinsing your sinuses (for example, by using a neti pot), use water that has been distilled or sterilized.

      "summary1": "Addison's disease is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system erroneously attacks the adrenal glands degrading the external layer. The condition occurs in only about 1-person per 100,000 but happens at all age levels in men and women. Addison's disease develops when the adrenal glands produce too little cortisol and inadequate levels of aldosterone, severely impacting your health. The adverse condition is often confused with adrenal insufficiency and if left untreated, can be life-threatening. The adrenal glands are positioned just above the kidneys. When these organs are damaged, it affects your endocrine system, disrupting hormone production. Hormones are vital and used to signal instructions to every tissue and organ in the body. The interior of your adrenal glands, known as the medulla, generate adrenaline hormones while the outer layer, known as the cortex, produces corticosteroids. Certain corticosteroids, glucocorticoids, and mineralocorticoids are essential for life. Treatment for Addison's disease requires hormone replacement therapy to balance the body's levels of adrenaline and return to a healthy baseline level. Here are 12 signs of Addison's disease, if you display any of the symptoms, consult with a medical professional.",

The US Navy's marine mammal unit plans to send 30 dolphins and sea lions to take part in NATO drills in an area dominated by Russian forces. Moscow-based newspaper Izvestia said the exercises, which could see American military dolphins nose-to-nose with their Russian counterparts, are expected to last for up to two weeks. The Black sea has become a tense focal point for Russian and Western navies amid the current crisis in Ukraine. Scroll down for video . Training mammals for naval operations including spying and mining of enemy ships began in the Cold War . Recently a low-flying Russian air force plane buzzed a U.S. warship sent to patrol here. The Ukrainian navy's warfare dolphins based in Sevastopol abruptly switched sides to Russia recently after Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea. Training mammals for naval operations for spying on and mining of enemy ships began in the Cold War by both the U.S. and the USSR. 'It may so happen that American and Russian military dolphins will meet in the open sea for the first time,' wrote Izvestia. Loyal: The army has been using the underwater mammals since the 70s, and they remained under Ukrainian command after the collapse of the Soviet Union . 'It is known that such dolphins are trained only in Russia and the USA.' The newspaper cited Tom LaPuzza, spokesman for the US Navy's marine mammals programme, as revealing that deployment of dolphins and sea lions was a first for NATO. An ITAR TASS report evidently quoting LaPuzza stated that in the Black Sea the U.S. dolphins would test a new anti-radar which is designed to 'disorientate enemy sonars while sea lions would look for mines and naval divers'. The U.S. is known to have trained dolphins and sea lions to identify intruders swimming in restricted areas, and the retrieve equipment lost at sea. It is understood some $14million (USD) is spent annually training the underwater mammals. They are also seen as skilled mine-finders by their military trainers. In action: One of the 'spy dolphins' is being moved from a pool into the sea, pictured in 1990, before the fall of the USSR . The American Navy Marine Mammal Program found that dolphin sonar, known as echolocation, 'makes them uniquely effective at locating sea mines so they can be avoided and removed', according to one account. After finding the mine, the dolphins signal the discovery to its crew by poking a ball with its nose. It then is given a buoy line or acoustic transponder to mark the spot. America also trains 'attack sea lions' to detect and snare enemy divers. They are taught to attach spring loaded clamps to frogmen who are they pulled backwards through the water by the mammals' naval handlers on a vessel. Part of the team: A military dolphin with two divers in this undated Russian military photo . 'It's difficult to put up effective resistance when you're being dragged backwards through the water,' LaPuzza has previously stated. Between 1986 and 1988 the U.S. Navy, which now has a fleet of at least 75 mine hunting dophins, deployed six on duties in the Persian Gulf. One, called Skippy, died of bacterial infection. Earlier, they were deployed in the Vietnam War. Uniquely, the U.S. has trained Beluga whales for deepwater operations. Izvestia reported that the U.S. mammals would be flown in to Ukraine on planes equipped with special baths when the creatures are constantly watered. U.S. Air Force pictures show how they were transported to New Caledonia in 2009 for exercises off Australia. LaPuzza was quoted denying that the American sea animals are trained to attack people. Search and rescue: Dolphins were sent on bomb missions when the army did not want to risk the life of a diver . 'On the contrary, as part of the training programme, they learn to save people. Their main activities are finding mines and divers.' The Russian bottlenose dolphins - until recently under Ukrainian command - are trained to hunt for mines, plant bombs on hostile ships or attack enemy divers with special knives or pistols fixed to their heads. The use of dolphins as naval assets was begun during the Cold War in Sevastopol by the Soviet Union in 1973. With the collapse of the USSR, they were enlisted in the Ukrainian navy which last month lost its headquarters in Sevastopol after Russia's audacious land grab in Crimea.

The Syrians are under guard for their own protection, he said. Israeli doctors frequently treat people from groups with which Israel has tensions, or even is engaged in conflict. In November, CNN visited an Israeli hospital treating an Israeli child and a Palestinian child, both wounded in warfare between Israel and militants in Gaza.

An Israeli military spokeswoman told CNN the Israel Defense Forces \"provided medical care to seven injured Syrians adjacent to the security fence between Israel and Syria in the Golan Heights, and the wounded were transferred to an Israeli hospital for further treatment.\" Embon said one of the seven patients is in severe condition in an intensive care unit.

Asked how the Syrians are responding to being treated in an Israeli hospital, Embon said only that their reaction \"is reasonable.\" Last month, Israeli fighter jets struck a Syrian convoy suspected of moving weapons to the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, a senior U.S. official said. Israeli Defense MInister Ehud Barak did not explicitly confirm or deny such an attack, but called the event \"another proof that when we say something we mean it -- we say that we don't think that it should be allowable to bring advanced weapon systems into Lebanon.\" Syria's government-run news agency SANA called Barak's statement \"an overt hint that the aggression came in implementation of the Israeli threats uttered lately under the pretext of targeting 'a weapons shipment.'\" The death toll in the Syrian war is probably approaching 70,000, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said last week. At least 61 \"martyrs\" were killed Sunday, the opposition Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Syria, which blames the violence on \"terrorists,\" said Sunday its military \"inflicted heavy losses\" on them. The United Nations and numerous countries, including the United States, have called on Syria to end its brutal crackdown on opposition fighters and called on all sides to halt the violence.\nSummary:\n",

Despite recruitment drives, the UK has one of the lowest numbers of practising medics per head in the EU. Only Ireland, Slovenia, Romania and Poland have fewer physicians, a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found. Shortage: Britain has one of the lowest doctor-to-patient ratios in the EU, says a new report (file photo) Britain has 2.8 doctors per thousand people – less than the EU average of 3.4 and below other major economies including Germany, Italy and France. Even former Communist states such as Lithuania and the Czech Republic have a greater proportion and Greece has more than twice as many doctors per head than the UK. Experts say the shortage in the NHS is most acute among GPs and A&E doctors. Last night Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, warned the shortage was risking patients. ‚öÑ≤When you have shortages of doctors in some areas it means longer waits,' he said. ‚öÑ≤In A&E that's not really an option, so it means doctors work harder and harder; it means there is a greater chance of mistakes, and ultimately it means risks to lives. ‚öÑ≤This has been going on the last three or four years – we cannot carry on like this.' Long wait: A&E departments are under strain . The report found that the number of doctors in the UK has increased more rapidly than in any other EU country since 2000, rising by over 50 per cent between 2000 and 2012. The rise was set in train by the Labour government, but has continued under the Tories even since the economic crash. ‚öÑ≤As a result, the United Kingdom had 2.8 practising physicians per 1000 population in 2012, up from 2.0 in 2000,' the OECD report said. ‚öÑ≤This nonetheless remains below the EU average of 3.4 doctors per 1000 population. ‚öÑ≤While most of the increase in the number of doctors in the United Kingdom in the early 2000s came from the entry of foreign-trained doctors, the situation changed just before the economic crisis with most of the increase now driven by a strong rise in the number of graduates from domestic medical education programmes. ‚öÑ≤This reflects a deliberate policy in the United Kingdom to reduce its reliance on foreign-trained doctors to meet its own needs.' Britain's proportion of doctors – 2.8 per 1,000 head of population in 2012 – is much lower, however, than Greece on 6.2, Austria on 4.9 and Lithuania on 4.4. Among our major European partners, Germany's rate is 4.0, Italy is on 3.9, Spain is 3.8 and France is on 3.3. The EU average is 3.4 per 1,000 population. Only four countries are below us – with the lowest being Poland on just 2.2. The OECD said Britain's rapid rise over the past decade had led to fears that doctors were being trained in the wrong specialisms – meaning they may have to be lain off in future years. ‚öÑ≤A growing number of doctors will improve access to health care, but will also put pressure on future health care budgets as more graduates enter the medical workforce,' the report said. ‚öÑ≤There are now concerns that there might be surpluses of certain categories of doctors in the years ahead. This has led to recommendations to reduce slightly student intakes in medical schools or post-graduate training for certain specialties.' Dr Mann, from the College of Emergency Medicine, added: ‚öÑ≤We have been warning for some years that we have got fewer doctors than most parts of the developed world. ‚öÑ≤When there aren't enough doctors to go round, they can pick and choose speciality and because of the levels of burnout in A&E, that means many are walking away, creating even greater shortages. ‚öÑ≤We have now got 500 A&E doctors trained in this country working in Australia – that's the equivalent of two full years of trained doctors. Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the British Medical Association, said: ‚öÑ≤The NHS is under incredible pressure from rising patient demand and flat-lining funding. ‚öÑ≤The government's announcement of additional resources in the autumn statement for the NHS is a step in the right direction, but it will not solve the long term under-doctoring of many parts of the NHS that is hindering patient care. ‚öÑ≤Key specialities such as emergency care and GP services are facing particularly acute shortages.' 1 Greece 6.2 . 2 Austria 4.9 . 3 Lithuania 4.4 . 4 Portugal 4.1 . 5 Germany 4.0 . 6 Sweden 3.9 . 7 Italy 3.9 . 8 Spain 3.8 . 9 Bulgaria 3.7 . 10 Czech Republic 3.7 . 11 Malta 3.5 . 12 Denmark 3.5 .

He added that obesity could be tackled by encouraging people to take more exercise, but that changing people's diets would be more effective. He cites research which suggests that when people are eating fats and proteins they stop when they are full, but that when they are eating sugars they will keep eating until their stomachs hurt. Paul van der Velpen, head of Amsterdam's health service, said that sugar is 'the most dangerous drug of our time' and that it is the main cause of the obesity epidemic . He believes this is because sugar is addictive and is ‚öÑ≤as hard to give up as smoking'. As a result, he says sugar should be taxed in the same way alcohol and cigarettes are. He also suggests that the amount of sugar that can be added to processed food should be regulated.\nSummary:\n",

      "article": "Tuberculosis has spread through a Kansas high school after a single case of the disease was discovered. Some 27 people have tested positive for latent TB infection at the school in eastern Kansas. State and county health officials made the announcement on Wednesday after tests were conducted on more than 300 Olathe Northwest High students and staff who came into contact with a student with TB disease. Officials called people who tested positive on Monday and those with no sign of infection were to receive letters in the mail. One student with TB at Olathe Northwest High School has led to 27 cases of the infection in eastern Kansas among fellow students and staff . According to the Johnson County Department of Heath and Environment, those with TB infection were not contagious, do not feel sick and do not have symptoms. People with TB disease can spread the bacteria to others, feel sick and have symptoms including fever, night sweats, cough and weight loss. Causes: Tuberculosis is spread from person to person through the air, when someone infected coughs, sneezes, laughs or sings. A person who breathes in the bacteria can become infected. Symptoms: General symptoms may include feeling weak or sick, weight loss, fever and/or night sweats. Symptoms of TB of the lungs may include coughing, chest pain and/or coughing up blood. Treatment: More than 13,000 cases are reported in the U.S. each year. There are also an estimated 10 to 15 million people in the U.S. who are infected with the TB germ, with potential to develop TB disease in the future. If a person gets a TB skin test and it comes back positive, they must take a variety of antibiotics daily for as long as six months. Director of the health department, Lougene Marsh, said: 'The number of individuals with TB infection does not exceed what we would anticipate in this setting.' Tuberculosis can be spread by coughing and sneezing. People with the disease were most likely to spread it to others with whom they have prolonged contact. According to the CDC, TB is caused by a bacterium called mycobacterium tuberculosis which attacks the lungs but can also infect the kidneys, spine, and brain. If not treated properly, the disease can be fatal. The Department of Heath and Environment said those who tested positive for TB will have a chest x-ray and begin a course of antibiotics to kill the TB bacteria. In May, those who were in the same class as the student with TB disease will be given another round of blood tests as it can sometimes take eight weeks for the bacteria to show itself. A total of 9,582 TB disease cases were reported in the U.S. in 2013 - compared to 84,304 cases when the CDC began records in 1953. The same year, 9 million people around the world became sick with TB disease, leading to 1.5 million deaths. A doctor examines the x-rays of a TB patient (stock image).
