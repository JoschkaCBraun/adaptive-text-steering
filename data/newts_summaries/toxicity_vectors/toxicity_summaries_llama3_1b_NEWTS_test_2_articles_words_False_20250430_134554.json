      "article": "The president of the World Bank on Saturday warned the United States was just 'days away' from causing a global economic disaster unless politicians come up with a plan to raise the nation's debt limit and avoid default. 'We're now five days away from a very dangerous moment. I urge US policymakers to quickly come to a resolution before they reach the debt ceiling deadline... Inaction could result in interest rates rising, confidence falling and growth slowing,' World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said in a briefing following a meeting of the bank's Development Committee. 'If this comes to pass, it could be a disastrous event for the developing world, and that will in turn greatly hurt developed economies as well,' he said. Scroll down for video . Disastrous: World Bank chief Jim Yong Kim warned Saturday that the United States was headed toward peril as politicians failed again to resolve a standoff over the budget . The alarming remarks from the Korean-American came after three days of talks revolving around meetings of the 188-nation International Monetary Fund and its sister lending agency, the World Bank, where top officials pressed the US to resolve the political impasse over the debt ceiling. The standoff has blocked approval of legislation to increase the government's borrowing limit before a fast-approaching Thursday deadline. US Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has warned that he will exhaust his borrowing authority on Thursday and the government will face the prospect of defaulting on its debt unless Congress raises the $16.7 trillion borrowing limit. 'We know there are problems,' Tharman Shanmugaratnam, the head of the IMF's policy-steering committee and Singapore's finance minister, told a news conference at the end of the IMF meeting. 'We know there are near-term risks, the most obvious one being what's going on in the US with regard to the fiscal deficit.' But one of the big near-term concerns, the expectation that the US Federal Reserve will start scaling back its massive stimulus program for the economy, is actually pointing to a positive development, Tharman said. Talks: Jim Yong Kim, (left), president, World Bank Group, and Christine Lagarde, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director, talk before a meeting of the Development Committee during the World Bank/IMF Annual Meetings in Washington . It means that the U.S. economy is strong enough to withstand a reduction of the stimulus. IMF officials have been forecasting that the strengthening U.S. economy will be a main driver of the global economy in the coming year. At the same time, developing country economies are slowing and their markets have been unsettled since May by anticipation that the Fed will soon begin tapering its $85-billion-a-month bond purchases, which poured cash into the economy to stimulate growth. 'The eventual normalisation of monetary policy as economies recover in the West will be a net positive for the emerging economies,' Tharman said, meaning that the strength of the major economies would help carry the global economy forward. Lew told finance ministers that the US understood the role it played as 'the anchor of the international financial system', and assured them the administration was doing all it could to reach a resolution on the debt. Stalemate: Speaker of the House John Boehner walks to his office after a meeting with fellow Republicans at the Capitol in Washington on Saturday . An effort Saturday to pass a one-year extension of the borrowing limit failed to get sufficient votes. But in a more hopeful sign, negotiations began between Democratic and Republican Senate leaders to end the impasse. Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, was one of a number of officials who were guardedly confident that an eleventh-hour deal would be reached, as it has in similar standoffs in the past. 'I still think it is unthinkable that an agreement won't be found,' Draghi told reporters on Saturday. 'If this situation were to last a long time, it would be very negative for the U.S. economy and the world economy and could certainly harm the recovery.' But once Draghi moved beyond the US impasse, he sounded upbeat about the prospects for a European recovery. That in itself is a dramatic turn from the past three years, when global financial leaders were taken up with waves of crisis sweeping across the region and necessitating a series of international rescue loans. Business not as usual: President Barack Obama yesterday discussed challenges from the partial government shutdown small business owners . The IMF called on emerging economies, which have been the drivers of the global economy in recent years, to undertake reforms that will help their economies better withstand the scaling back of monetary stimulus in the U.S. and other major economies. When the stimulus money was flowing, emerging economies benefited from investments as investors were attracted by their relatively higher rates of interest vis-a-vis the United States and other major economies. But many of those same countries that benefited from capital flows have been rocked since May, as the investment flows reversed and flowed back toward the US as rates here began to rise. Alexandre Tombini, the head Brazil's central bank, told the IMF steering committee that the worries about the US and global economies might be overblown. 'A while ago there was an excess of exuberance and now perhaps an excess of pessimism,' he said. Negotiating: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada is surrounded by reporters as he leaves the Senate floor to meet with Senate Democrats regarding the government shutdown and debt ceiling . Time is ticking: Republican Senator from Kentucky Mitch McConnell walks off the Senate floor after a vote on the motion to proceed on the Debt Limit Bill . The stark warnings from the World Bank came the same day that House Speaker John Boehner today told fellow Republicans that his talks with President Barack Obama have stalled. 'The Senate needs to hold tough,' Representative Greg Walden said Boehner told House GOP lawmakers. 'The president now isn't negotiating with us.' Obama rejected the speaker's effort to lift the debt ceiling for six weeks and reopen government in exchange for a budget negotiating process. Attention now turns to the Senate, where a bipartisan group of Senators are working on a separate plan to reopen the government. New plan: Republican Senator from Maine Susan Collins leaves a Republican meeting and heads to the Senate floor to vote on the motion to proceed on the Debt Limit Bill . Word of the negotiations between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and the top Republican, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, emerged as the Senate, as expected, rejected a Democratic effort to raise the government's borrowing limit through next year. Republicans objected because they want the extension to be accompanied by spending cuts. The calendar is edging closer to the October 17 deadline to raise the federal debt ceiling. After that, administration officials have said the government will deplete its ability to borrow money, risking a first-time federal default that could jolt the world economy.",

Manchester City are the best-paid sports team in the world, with average first-team pay a whopping £5.3m a year, or £102,653 per week according to a new report that compares global earnings in the most popular leagues. Five Premier League sides make the top 20 on the list, with Liverpool - City's title showdown opponents from Sunday - in 20th place, earning an average of £3.4m per man per year. Manchester United are at No 8 on £4.3m per man per year, Champions League semi-finalists Chelsea are at No 10 (nearly £4m) and Arsenal are at No 11 (£3.9m). Scroll down to see the table of the world's highest-paid sports teams . High earners: Manchester City have topped a global sports salary list, with their squad paid £5.3m a year . Big spender: City owner Sheik Mansour has invested hundreds of millions into making them title challengers . Blank cheque: Manuel Pellegrini could sign pretty much any player in the world for City . Two giants from American baseball, the New York Yankees and the LA Dodgers, as well as the two giants of Spanish football, Real Madrid and Barcelona, fill out the top five behind City. The top 10 also includes the Brooklyn Nets of the NBA (at No 6), Bayern Munich (No 7), and the Chicago Bulls of the NBA (No 9). The Global Sports Salaries Survey (GSSS), produced for ESPN The Magazine in the USA, has been tracking comparative pay at major sports teams for five years. City players were earning an average of just under £1.5m a year each when Sheik Mansour arrived in 2008 but their pay has more than trebled in the six years of his ownership. Chelsea have also seen their wages and . fortunes soar since Roman Abramovich arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2003 . but foreign sugar-daddy ownership is not restricted to elite European . football. Big hitters: The New York Yankees baseball team ranked second on the earners' list . Coining it in: The Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team are third on the salary list with an average annual pay of £5.1m but they moved down from second place last year . The Brooklyn Nets were bought in 2010 by one of Abramovich's fellow Russian billionaires, Mikhail Prokhorov. Not only is Prokhorov footing the Nets' $102m (around £61m) total payroll in 2013-14, or £4.5m per player this year, but he will need to pay an additional $70m (around £42m) or thereabouts in luxury tax for exceeding the NBA's wage cap. On the list: Chelsea were 10th in the rankings with a £3.9m wage bill and still have a chance of winning the Premier League title this season . Wealth: Roman Abramovich has poured millions into Chelsea since he became owner in 2003 . Close call: Arsenal are just behind Chelsea in the survey. They advanced to the final of the FA Cup at the weekend, beating Wigan on penalties at Wembley . Sneaking in: Liverpool came in 20th in the salary list with an annual spend of £3.4m on wages each year. That could increase if they win their first league title in 24 years next month . Overpaid? Manchester United came in eighth in the list but have fallen short in the Premier League and Champions League this season .
